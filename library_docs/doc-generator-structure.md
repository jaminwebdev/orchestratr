# Core Structure Pattern

### 1. **Goal Section (Strategic Context)**

- Define the document's purpose and strategic importance
- Explain how it fits into the broader project lifecycle
- Specify the target audience and stakeholders
- Establish the document as a "source of truth" for specific decisions

Example:
```text
## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, actionable Product Brief in Markdown format that serves as the foundational document for all subsequent project planning. The brief should be comprehensive enough for stakeholders at all levels - from junior developers to senior leadership - to understand the product vision, requirements, and implementation approach.

The generated product brief will serve as the single source of truth and be referenced throughout the entire development lifecycle, including features documentation, user stories, user flows, UX/UI design, content strategy, technical architecture, testing plans, and go-to-market strategy.
```

### 2. **Process Section (Execution Framework)**

- Break down document creation into discrete, sequential steps
- Include document review/analysis phases before generation
- Require validation and quality checks
- End with save/versioning instructions

Example:
```text
## Process

1. **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new app/product idea.
2. **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the comprehensive question framework below to gather all necessary information through multiple rounds of clarifying questions.
3. **Validate Understanding:** Summarize key findings and confirm alignment before proceeding.
4. **Generate Comprehensive Product Brief:** Create a detailed brief using the enhanced structure outlined below.
5. **Review and Refine:** Ensure completeness, clarity, and actionability.
6. **Save Product Brief:** Save as `master-product-brief.md` in the `/docs` directory.
```
### 3. **Discovery Framework (Information Gathering)**

- Organize questions by thematic categories (using emojis for visual hierarchy)
- Ask specific, actionable questions rather than general ones
- Include both functional and contextual questions
- Address multiple perspectives (user, business, technical)

Example:
```text

- Establish measurable success criteria

Example: 
```text
Before finalizing the product brief, ensure:

- [ ] All sections are complete and detailed
- [ ] Technical requirements are specific and measurable
- [ ] User needs are clearly articulated with supporting evidence
- [ ] Competitive analysis is thorough and current
- [ ] Success metrics are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Next steps are actionable and assigned
- [ ] Document is suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All assumptions are clearly stated
- [ ] Dependencies and constraints are identified
```

### 6. **Best Practices for Document Generation Rules**

Example:
```text
## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** Avoid vague language; use concrete examples and measurable criteria
2. **Think Systemically:** Consider how features interact and affect the overall user experience
3. **Plan for Scale:** Address both current needs and future growth scenarios
4. **Consider Edge Cases:** Think through unusual but possible user scenarios
5. **Validate Assumptions:** Clearly state assumptions and plans for validation
6. **Keep Users Central:** Every decision should be justified by user value
7. **Balance Ambition with Reality:** Set challenging but achievable goals
8. **Document Trade-offs:** Explain why certain decisions were made over alternatives
```

### 7. **Output Requirements**

Example:
```text
## Output Requirements

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Filename:** `master-product-brief.md`
- **Length:** Comprehensive but concise (typically 15-25 pages)
- **Audience:** Accessible to stakeholders at all technical levels
- **Maintenance:** Include version control and update procedures
```

### 8. **Final Instructions**

Example: 
```text
## Final Instructions

1. **DO NOT** start implementing the product brief until all discovery questions are answered
2. **DO** ask follow-up questions to clarify ambiguous or incomplete responses
3. **DO** validate your understanding by summarizing key points before proceeding
4. **DO** ensure the brief is comprehensive enough to guide all subsequent project phases

5. **DO** include specific, actionable next steps and clear success criteria
```

### 9. **Success Factors**

Example: 
```text
## Key Success Factors

1. **Comprehensive but Focused:** Cover all necessary aspects without overwhelming detail
2. **Evidence-Based:** Require justification and sources for key decisions
3. **Iterative Validation:** Multiple checkpoints prevent drift from strategy
4. **Cross-Functional Design:** Serve multiple team roles and decision-making needs
5. **Future-Oriented:** Consider evolution and maintenance requirements
6. **Actionable Outputs:** Generate documents that drive concrete next steps
```


## Additional Considerations

### **Sequential Document Dependencies**

- Always require review of previous documents before starting new ones
- Create explicit integration points between documents
- Validate alignment and identify conflicts between documents
- Build knowledge progressively rather than in isolation

### **Structured Information Architecture**

- Use consistent categorization across all rules (Goals, Process, Discovery, Output, QA)
- Apply thematic grouping with visual indicators (emojis, headers)
- Create logical information hierarchies
- Ensure templates support both creation and future reference

### **Multi-Perspective Discovery**

- Include user, business, technical, and market perspectives
- Ask both "what" and "why" questions
- Address current state and future evolution
- Consider edge cases and constraints

### **Actionability Focus**

- Require specific, measurable criteria rather than general descriptions
- Include implementation guidance and next steps
- Define success metrics for each document
- Ensure outputs can drive concrete decisions

### **Quality Control Framework**

- Create multiple validation checkpoints
- Require specific evidence or justification for key decisions
- Include both content quality and strategic alignment checks
- Establish regular review and update procedures
