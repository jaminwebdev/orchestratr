# Rule: Product Brief Generation

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, actionable Product Brief in Markdown format. This document serves as the foundational "source of truth" for the entire project, defining the core vision, scope, and strategy.

The brief must be comprehensive enough for all stakeholders‚Äîfrom developers and designers to senior leadership and marketing teams‚Äîto understand the product's purpose, requirements, and success criteria. The generated Product Brief will be referenced by all subsequent rules to ensure consistency across all documentation.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a high-level description or request for a new application or product idea.
2.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the comprehensive question framework below to gather all necessary information. Ask clarifying questions until all sections can be confidently completed.
3.  **Review Supporting Docs:** Reference relevant documents from the `/library_docs/` directory (e.g., business goals, brand identity guidelines) if provided.
4.  **Validate Understanding:** Before generating the full document, summarize the core vision, target audience, and key features to confirm alignment with the user.
5.  **Generate Comprehensive Product Brief:** Create a detailed brief using the `Document Structure` template outlined below.
6.  **Quality Assurance:** Perform a full review using the `Quality Assurance Framework` to ensure the document is complete, clear, and actionable.
7.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `01_product_brief.md` in the `/docs/` directory.

## Integration with Other Documentation

  * **As a Source:** This is the foundational document. It does not depend on other generated documents. It is the **primary input** for all subsequent documents, including:
      * `02_market_user_research.mdc`: Validates the assumptions made in this brief.
      * `03_feature_spec.mdc`: Breaks down the features defined here into detailed specifications.
      * All other documents in the sequence.
  * **Supporting Docs:** This rule should reference documents in the `/library_docs/` directory, such as brand guidelines, company mission statements, or existing market research, to inform its creation.

## Best Practices

1.  **Be Specific:** Avoid vague language. Use concrete examples and measurable criteria.
2.  **Stay Focused on the "Why":** Continuously tie features and decisions back to the core problem you're solving.
3.  **Validate Assumptions:** Clearly state all assumptions and create a plan to validate them through research.
4.  **Keep Users Central:** Every decision should be justified by the value it provides to the user.
5.  **Document Trade-offs:** If a key decision was made (e.g., choosing one platform over another), briefly explain why.
6.  **Aim for Clarity over Length:** A shorter, clearer brief is more effective than a long, confusing one.

## Output Requirements

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
  - **Location:** `/docs/`
  - **Filename:** `01_product_brief.md`
  - **Audience:** Accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  - **Style:** Clear, concise, and scannable. Use headers, lists, and bold text to improve readability.

## Final Instructions

1.  **DO NOT** generate the brief until all critical discovery questions have been answered. It is better to ask more questions than to proceed with incomplete information.
2.  **DO** ask follow-up questions to clarify any ambiguous or incomplete user responses.
3.  **DO** use the exact Markdown structure provided in the `Document Structure` section.
4.  **DO** end the process by listing the immediate "Next Steps" to guide the user to the next phase of the project.

## Key Success Factors

1.  **Clarity & Alignment:** The final document creates a shared understanding and alignment across the entire team and all stakeholders.
2.  **Actionability:** The brief is detailed and specific enough to directly inform the next stage (Market & User Research) without requiring further clarification.
3.  **Focus:** It clearly defines the scope of the MVP, providing a strong defense against scope creep.
4.  **Evidence-Based:** Key claims about user problems and market opportunities feel well-reasoned, even if they are assumptions to be validated later.
5.  **Future-Oriented:** While focused on the MVP, it sets a clear direction for the product's future evolution.
