# Rule: Market & User Research Generation

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a combined Market and User Research document in Markdown format. This document's primary purpose is to validate (or invalidate) the assumptions made in the `/docs/01_product_brief.md` and to build a deep, evidence-based understanding of the competitive landscape and the target users.

This research will serve as a critical input for feature specification, design and UX decisions, and the go-to-market strategy. It ensures the product is built on a solid foundation of market reality and user empathy.

## Process

1.  **Review Dependencies:** The process must begin with a thorough review of the `/docs/01_product_brief.md`. Identify and list all key assumptions about the target market, user personas, pain points, and competitors.
2.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the discovery framework below to gather information about research methodologies, data sources, and specific areas of investigation.
3.  **Review Supporting Docs:** Reference relevant documents from the `/library_docs/` directory, such as `user_interview_best_practices.md`, `competitive_analysis_framework.md`, or `keyword_research_process.md`.
4.  **Synthesize and Generate Document:** Analyze all inputs (Product Brief assumptions, user responses, library docs) to synthesize findings. Generate the research document using the detailed `Document Structure` provided below.
5.  **Quality Assurance:** Use the `Quality Assurance Framework` to ensure the research is well-supported, the personas are detailed and realistic, and the strategic recommendations are logically derived from the findings.
6.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `02_market_user_research.md` in the `/docs/` directory.

## Discovery Framework

### üîç Research Scope & Methodology

  * **Primary Goal:** What is the single most important question we need this research to answer? (e.g., "Is there a real market need for this?" or "Which user segment should we prioritize?")
  * **Existing Data:** What existing user data, analytics, or previous research can we leverage?
  * **Research Methods:** What research methods will be used? (e.g., User Interviews, Surveys, Competitor Analysis, Industry Reports, Keyword Analysis).
  * **Timeline & Ownership:** What is the timeline for this research phase, and who is responsible for gathering the data?

### üè¢ Market Analysis

  * **Market Data Sources:** Where can we find reliable data on market size, growth, and trends? (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, Statista, industry publications).
  * **Competitor Identification:** Beyond the competitors listed in the brief, how will we find others? What tools will we use?
  * **Competitive Analysis Criteria:** On what specific criteria will we compare competitors? (e.g., Pricing, Core Features, Target Audience, Marketing Strategy, User Reviews).
  * **Positioning:** What market gaps or opportunities for differentiation are we hoping to find?

### üë• User Persona Development

  * **Persona Count:** How many distinct user personas do we need to create to represent our target audience (typically 2-4)?
  * **Recruitment:** How will we find and recruit people who fit our target user profiles for interviews or surveys?
  * **Information Gathering:** For each potential persona, what specific information do we need to uncover?
      * **Demographics:** What is their age, location, job title, and industry?
      * **Goals & Motivations:** What are they trying to achieve? What drives their decisions?
      * **Pain Points & Frustrations:** What are the specific obstacles and annoyances they face with their current solutions? Ask for stories.
      * **Behaviors & Habits:** What does a typical day look like for them? What tools, software, or websites do they use regularly?
      * **Context of Use:** Where and when would they use our product? (e.g., at a desk, on the go with a mobile device).

### üí° Synthesis & Validation

  * **Key Findings:** After the research, what were the 3-5 most surprising or important findings?
  * **Assumption Validation:** Which key assumptions from the Product Brief were validated by the research? Which were proven wrong?
  * **Strategic Impact:** Based on the findings, what should we change about our product strategy, target audience, or positioning?

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Research Rigor Checks

  - [ ] Are the research **methods** clearly defined and appropriate for the goals?
  - [ ] Is the **sample size** and participant profile for user research clearly stated?
  - [ ] Is the competitive analysis based on specific, objective **criteria**?
  - [ ] Is there a clear separation between research **observations** (what users said/did) and **interpretations** (what it means)?

### Content & Clarity Checks

  - [ ] Are the **personas** detailed, distinct, and based on real data, not stereotypes? Do they feel like real people?
  - [ ] Does the **Competitive Feature Matrix** provide a clear at-a-glance summary?
  - [ ] Are the **strategic recommendations** a direct and logical result of the stated findings?
  - [ ] Does the document **explicitly confirm or challenge** the core assumptions from the Product Brief?

## Integration with Other Documentation

  * **Source Document:** This rule **must** begin by analyzing `/docs/01_product_brief.md`. Its primary function is to provide evidence that supports or refutes the brief's assumptions.
  * **As a Source:** This research document is the **primary input** for:
      * `03_feature_spec.mdc`: To ensure features are prioritized based on validated user needs and market gaps.
      * `04_design_guidelines.mdc`: To inform user empathy, user journey mapping, and content strategy (voice/tone).
      * Go-to-Market strategies and marketing copy.

## Best Practices

1.  **Separate Observation from Interpretation:** First, state what you saw or heard. Then, state what you think it means. (e.g., "Observation: 6 of 8 users mentioned 'too many notifications'. Interpretation: Users are feeling overwhelmed by their current tools.")
2.  **Use Verbatim Quotes:** Include powerful, direct quotes from users. They build empathy more effectively than summaries.
3.  **Visualize Data:** Use tables (like the feature matrix) and charts where possible to make data easier to digest.
4.  **Focus on the "Why":** Dig deeper than just what users *say* they want. Understand their underlying motivations and goals.
5.  **Personas are Tools for Empathy:** Create personas that the entire team can reference to ask, "What would [Persona Name] think of this feature?"

## Output Requirements

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
  - **Location:** `/docs/`
  - **Filename:** `02_market_user_research.md`
  - **Audience:** Product managers, designers, engineers, marketers, and key stakeholders.
  - **Style:** Data-driven but narrative. Tell the story of your market and users.

## Final Instructions

1.  **DO NOT** create personas or findings based on speculation. The document's value comes from being grounded in real research data.
2.  **DO** be explicit about which assumptions from the product brief were validated, invalidated, or require further research. This is a core function of the document.
3.  **DO** prioritize findings and recommendations that will have the biggest impact on the project's strategy and direction.
4.  **DO** ensure the personas are distinct and represent meaningful segments of your target audience.

## Key Success Factors

1.  **Insightful:** The document provides non-obvious insights that can give the product a competitive advantage.
2.  **Empathetic:** It creates a strong sense of empathy for the target user across the entire team.
3.  **Actionable:** The findings translate directly into clear strategic recommendations for the product, design, and marketing teams.
4.  **Validating:** It successfully serves its purpose by confirming or correcting the project's strategic direction at an early stage, saving time and resources.
5.  **Clarity:** The difference between data, analysis, and recommendations is clear to all readers.
