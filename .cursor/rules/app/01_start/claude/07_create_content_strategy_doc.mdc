## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a comprehensive **Content Strategy** document that establishes the framework for creating, organizing, delivering, and maintaining all content across the product ecosystem.

This document ensures that every piece of content‚Äîfrom microcopy and error messages to help documentation and marketing materials‚Äîis strategically aligned with user needs, business objectives, and brand voice, creating a cohesive and purposeful content experience that supports user success and product goals.

   - `features.md` - Content requirements per feature, user guidance needs, and complexity levels
   - `ux-design-considerations.md` - Brand voice, tone guidelines, and content hierarchy principles
   - `user-flows.md` - Content touchpoints, decision support needs, and contextual guidance requirements
   - `market-analysis.md` - Industry content standards, competitive messaging analysis, and market positioning (if available)

### 2. **Content Ecosystem Assessment**

   Ensure the strategy provides:
   - Clear guidelines for content creators and developers
