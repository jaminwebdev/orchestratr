# Rule: Generating Security & Compliance Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a comprehensive **Security & Compliance Plan** that establishes a robust security posture covering data protection, infrastructure security, access controls, regulatory compliance, and incident response. This plan ensures security is integrated throughout the entire product lifecycle, from development to deployment and ongoing operations.

The document should provide actionable security controls for engineering teams, auditable compliance frameworks for stakeholders, risk assessment methodologies for leadership, and measurable security metrics for continuous improvement. It must align with industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and modern threat landscapes.

## Process

1. **Reference Previous Docs (MANDATORY):**

   - `features.md` - For understanding data flows, user interactions, and attack surfaces
   - `architecture-design-patterns.md` - For technical security implementation details and infrastructure security
   - `user-personas.md` - For identifying user behavior patterns and potential threat vectors
   - `market-analysis.md` - For understanding competitive security standards and industry expectations
   - `user-flows.md` - For mapping security controls to user journeys and identifying vulnerable touchpoints
   - `ux-design-considerations.md` - For balancing security with usability requirements
   - `content-strategy.md` - For content security policies and user-generated content risks

2. **Data & Privacy Assessment Questions:**
   - What types of personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected, processed, and stored?
   - Will you handle special categories of data (health, financial, biometric, children's data)?
   - What is the data retention strategy and legal basis for processing?
   - How will user consent be obtained, managed, and withdrawn?
   - What third-party data processors will have access to user data?

3. **Regulatory & Compliance Landscape:**

   - Are you targeting regulated industries (healthcare, finance, education, government)?
   - Will payments be processed directly or through compliant third parties?
   - Are there industry-specific standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP)?
   - What are the data residency and cross-border transfer requirements?

4. **Authentication & Access Control Requirements:**
   - What user roles and permission levels are required?
   - Will there be administrative access or privileged user accounts?
   - Are there enterprise SSO or federation requirements?
   - What authentication methods are acceptable to users and regulators?
   - How will account recovery and password reset be handled securely?

5. **Threat Landscape & Risk Assessment:**
   - What are the most valuable assets and likely attack targets?
   - Who are the potential threat actors (external hackers, insiders, competitors)?
   - What would be the business impact of different types of security incidents?
   - Are there known vulnerabilities in the chosen technology stack?
   - What are the reputational and financial risks of security failures?

6. **Infrastructure & Operational Security:**
   - How will secrets and credentials be managed across environments?
   - What is the production access control and change management process?
   - How will security be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?
   - What monitoring and alerting capabilities are needed for security events?
   - How will security patches and updates be managed?

7. **Generate the Security & Compliance Plan** using the comprehensive structure below.
