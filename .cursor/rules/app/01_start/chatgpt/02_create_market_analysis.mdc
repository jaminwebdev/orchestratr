# Rule: Creating a Market Analysis Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a clear, actionable Market Analysis document in Markdown format, based on the previously completed Product Brief. The Market Analysis should help validate the product's opportunity, competitive landscape, and positioning strategy.

This document will support future decisions around feature prioritization, product strategy, and go-to-market planning. It should be comprehensible to product managers, designers, and developers.

## Process

1. **Reference the Product Brief:** Begin with the existing `master-product-brief.md` in the `/docs` folder.
2. **Ask Follow-up Questions (if needed):** If critical market details are missing (e.g. competitors, trends, pricing models), prompt the user for more information.
3. **Generate Market Analysis:** Use the structure below to compile a comprehensive overview of the product‚Äôs market landscape.
4. **Save Document:** Save the final document as `market-analysis.md` in the `/docs` directory.

## Key Questions to Explore

üìà **Market Landscape**
- What industry or sector does this product target?
- Is the market growing, shrinking, or shifting in any notable ways?
- What current trends (technological, behavioral, economic) are influencing this market?
- What‚Äôs the estimated market size (TAM, SAM, SOM)?

üéØ **Target Segments**
- What niches or subgroups exist within this market?
- Which segments will be prioritized initially?
- Are there underserved or overlooked audiences?

‚öîÔ∏è **Competitive Analysis**
- Who are the direct and indirect competitors?
- What do those competitors do well?
- What are their weaknesses or gaps?
- How is pricing structured for similar products?
- What user complaints or frustrations exist in competitor offerings?

üèÖ **Positioning & Differentiation**
- What makes this product unique?
- What specific value or experience does it offer that others don‚Äôt?
- Is this a cost leader, premium offering, or niche solution?

üß† **Strategic Insights**
- Are there barriers to entry (e.g., tech complexity, regulation)?
- Are there network effects or viral loops?
- What risks or assumptions need to be validated?

## Output

* **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
* **Location:** `/docs/`
* **Filename:** `market-analysis.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate the Market Analysis immediately.
2. First, review the product brief and ask the user for any missing market/competitor info.

3. Use their responses to create a thoughtful, research-backed analysis that informs future decisions.
