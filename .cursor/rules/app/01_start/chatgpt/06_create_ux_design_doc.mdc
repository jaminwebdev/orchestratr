# Rule: Generating UX & Design Considerations

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a **UX & Design Considerations** document that outlines the visual direction, interaction principles, emotional tone, and branding guidance for the product.

This document should serve as a creative brief for designers and frontend developers, summarizing the design language, usability goals, emotional tone, and accessibility principles that should guide the interface design process.

## Process

1. **Reference Previous Docs:** Use the following as context:
   - `master-product-brief.md`
   - `user-personas.md`
   - `features.md`
   - `user-flows.md`

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions (if needed):**
   - If visual tone, branding, or design inspirations are not already discussed, prompt the user to describe or upload examples.
   - Ask for adjectives that describe the product‚Äôs personality (e.g. playful, professional, elegant).
   - Confirm color palette preferences, typography styles, and branding constraints (if any).

3. **Generate UX & Design Considerations:** Based on user input and existing docs, structure the output into the following sections:

## Recommended Document Structure

### üé® Visual Direction
- Key adjectives that describe the brand or product‚Äôs personality (e.g. clean, vibrant, minimalist)
- Desired look and feel (e.g. soft edges vs sharp, light vs dark theme, skeuomorphic vs flat)
- Color palette suggestions or constraints
- Typography preferences or guidelines
- Preferred use of imagery, iconography, or illustrations

### üß† UX Principles
- Core usability priorities (e.g. speed, simplicity, predictability)
- Any accessibility considerations (e.g. WCAG, screen reader support)
- Interaction style (e.g. gesture-based, form-heavy, voice commands)
- Animation/microinteraction philosophy (subtle feedback, expressive, none)

### üì± Platform-Specific Guidelines
- Should the experience differ between mobile and desktop?
- Responsive design strategy (breakpoints, stacking, collapsible menus)
- Any native platform conventions to follow (iOS/Android/Material/etc.)

### ü™Ñ Tone and Emotion
- What feelings should the UI evoke (e.g. trust, excitement, calm)?
- Should the tone be formal or conversational?
- Voice/personality of the UI copy (if relevant)

### üß≠ UX Priorities by Feature or Flow
- Notes on UX decisions for specific features (e.g. onboarding should feel warm and fast; checkout should minimize friction)
- Areas where simplicity or speed are most critical
- Role-specific UX needs (e.g. admins vs end users)

### üñºÔ∏è Design Inspirations (optional)
- References to apps, websites, or brands the user likes
- Links to screenshots, Dribbble, Behance, Figma, etc.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

- What are 3‚Äì5 adjectives that describe your desired brand feel?
- Are there specific apps or websites you admire from a design perspective?
- Do you have a logo, color palette, or typeface already?
- Do you want a light mode, dark mode, or both?
- Should the app feel more corporate or more creative/playful?
- What are the most important emotional reactions you want users to feel?
- Do you want animations or microinteractions?

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Filename:** `ux-design-considerations.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate the document immediately.
2. Ask the user for branding guidance, adjectives, and style references if not already covered.
3. Organize the design guidance into clear sections for visual style, UX goals, tone, and platform-specific notes.
4. Be descriptive enough that a designer could begin creating mockups based on the content alone.
