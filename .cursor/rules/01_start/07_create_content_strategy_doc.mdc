# Rule: Generating Content Strategy Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a **Content Strategy** document that outlines how content will be created, structured, delivered, and maintained across the product.

This document ensures that product copy, microcopy, help content, marketing messaging, and other written/visual content are consistent, purposeful, and aligned with both user goals and brand voice.

## Process

1. **Reference Previous Docs:** Pull insights from:
   - `master-product-brief.md`
   - `user-personas.md`
   - `features.md`
   - `ux-design-considerations.md`
   - `user-flows.md`

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions (if needed):**
   - What tone and style should be used across the app?
   - Are there specific content types the app relies on (e.g., blog posts, product descriptions, help docs, tooltips)?
   - Will content be user-generated, admin-authored, or AI-generated?
   - How frequently will content need to be updated?
   - Should SEO or accessibility considerations be factored in?
   - Are there language, localization, or translation needs?

3. **Generate the Content Strategy Document** using the structure below.

## Recommended Document Structure

### üß≠ Purpose & Content Goals
- What content is needed to help users succeed?
- How does content support the product‚Äôs primary goals (onboarding, engagement, conversion, retention)?
- Will content educate, persuade, reassure, or entertain?

### ‚úçÔ∏è Tone, Voice, and Style
- Adjectives that describe the voice (e.g., clear, confident, playful, instructional)
- Notes on vocabulary level, formality, and consistency
- Grammar/stylistic preferences (e.g. Oxford comma, sentence casing)
- Any "do/don‚Äôt" guidelines for brand-aligned writing

### üóÇÔ∏è Content Types & Sources
- UI microcopy (buttons, errors, success states)
- Help/support content (tooltips, FAQs, onboarding)
- System messages (notifications, alerts)
- User-generated vs platform-generated content
- Blog, documentation, newsletters, etc.

### üìç Content Placement & Flows
- Where in the app does content appear (and when)?
- Are certain flows content-heavy (e.g. onboarding, checkout, feature tutorials)?
- Notes on contextual help or progressive disclosure

### üåç Localization & Accessibility
- Will the app support multiple languages?
- Any accessibility standards (e.g., alt text, screen reader support)?
- Reading level targets?

### üîÑ Content Maintenance & Governance
- Who writes and approves content?
- How often is content reviewed or updated?
- Is there a versioning or revision history system?

### üîç SEO or External Strategy (if applicable)
- Will content appear in public-facing areas (blogs, landing pages)?
- Are keywords, metadata, or schema markup required?
- Will there be a publishing calendar or growth-focused content plan?

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

- What type of writing tone should your product maintain (formal, casual, techy, helpful)?
- Are there specific flows or areas in the app where content will play a critical role?
- Do you want content to educate, persuade, or simply direct users?
- Will your content team maintain this over time, or is it more static?
- Will this app need to support multiple languages?
- Are there external-facing content needs (marketing, SEO)?

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Filename:** `content-strategy.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate the content strategy until user preferences are clear.
2. Ask clarifying questions about tone, flow, localization, and update frequency.
3. Ensure the document gives both high-level philosophy and practical, actionable rules.
4. Be specific enough that a UX writer or frontend engineer could use it to write production-ready copy.
