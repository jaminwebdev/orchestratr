# Rule: Generating User Personas

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a set of clear, well-defined User Personas in Markdown format. These personas help articulate who the product is for, what they need, and how they behave ‚Äî grounding the product team‚Äôs design, features, and messaging decisions.

User personas should be based on either:
- The user's responses to clarifying questions, or
- The AI‚Äôs best effort using insights from the `master-product-brief.md` and `market-analysis.md` documents, if the user prefers to auto-generate them.

Each persona should feel realistic and specific enough to inform UX, design, and development decisions, especially for junior or mid-level team members.

## Process

1. **Reference Existing Docs:** Review `master-product-brief.md` and `market-analysis.md` inside the `/docs/` directory.
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Ask the user for more information if details about the audience, segments, or user types are lacking.
3. **Offer to Auto-Generate:** If the user prefers not to define personas manually, offer to generate them using current industry best practices, product context, and known audience patterns.
4. **Generate Personas:** Create 2‚Äì4 primary personas. Optionally, include secondary personas or anti-personas (users the product is not designed for).
5. **Save the Document:** Output as `user-personas.md` inside the `/docs/` folder.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

üë• **Who Are Your Users?**
- Who is the product primarily designed for?
- Are there distinct user groups or tiers (e.g. end-users, admins, clients)?
- What roles do they typically have (job title, life stage, industry)?

üìç **Demographics & Context**
- What‚Äôs their age range, location, education, income level?
- What devices and platforms do they use daily?
- Are they individual consumers, freelancers, business users, etc.?

üß† **Motivations & Goals**
- What are their primary goals when using this product?
- What outcomes are they hoping to achieve?
- What‚Äôs frustrating about their current tools or workflows?

üß± **Barriers & Pain Points**
- What might prevent them from using this app?
- Are there technical, emotional, or procedural obstacles?

üîç **Behavioral Patterns**
- How tech-savvy are they?
- When and where would they use this product?
- How frequently do they engage with similar tools or apps?

üé® **Tone & Expectations**
- What tone or style of communication resonates with them?
- Do they prefer speed, control, simplicity, customization?

## Format Suggestions

Each persona should include:
- **Name & Role**
- **Short Bio**
- **Demographics**
- **Goals & Needs**
- **Pain Points**
- **Device & Platform Habits**
- **Behavior Traits & Tech Familiarity**

You may also optionally include:
- A photo or illustration placeholder
- A "Quote" that captures their mindset
- Anti-personas (who the product is *not* built for)

## Output

* **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
* **Location:** `/docs/`
* **Filename:** `user-personas.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate personas immediately.
2. First, review previous documents and ask the user for any missing context.
3. Offer the user the choice to provide input or allow the AI to generate the personas using best practices.
4. Make sure personas are realistic, actionable, and relevant to the product‚Äôs goals.
