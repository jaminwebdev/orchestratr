# Rule: Generating Post-MVP Growth & Iteration Plan Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a clear **Post-MVP Growth & Iteration Plan** that outlines strategies for product improvement, scaling, and feature expansion after the Minimum Viable Product launch.

This plan should enable the product and engineering teams to prioritize enhancements, gather feedback, and iteratively grow the product in alignment with user needs and business goals.

## Process

1. **Reference Previous Docs:**
   - `master-product-brief.md`
   - `features.md`
   - `analytics-success-metrics.md`
   - `user-personas.md`
   - `testing-qa-strategy.md`

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions (if needed):**
   - What are the key user feedback channels post-launch?
   - How will feature requests be prioritized and validated?
   - What metrics will guide iteration priorities?
   - Are there plans for new user segments or markets?
   - What is the cadence for releases and updates?
   - How will technical debt and refactoring be handled?
   - Are there marketing or growth initiatives planned (e.g., SEO, partnerships)?

3. **Generate the Post-MVP Growth & Iteration Plan** using the structure below.

## Recommended Document Structure

### üöÄ Growth Goals & Metrics
- User acquisition, engagement, retention targets
- Revenue and monetization growth goals
- Expansion into new markets or segments

### üì£ User Feedback & Validation
- Channels for collecting feedback (surveys, support, analytics)
- Process for validating and prioritizing feature requests
- Beta testing and early access programs

### üîÑ Iteration & Release Cadence
- Frequency and scope of releases (minor updates, major versions)
- Agile methodologies and sprint planning
- Rollback and hotfix procedures

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Maintenance
- Handling technical debt and codebase improvements
- Refactoring plans
- Infrastructure scaling and optimization

### üìà Marketing & Growth Initiatives
- SEO, content marketing, and social media plans
- Partnerships, integrations, and collaborations
- Paid acquisition and advertising strategies

### üéØ Success Measurement
- KPIs and OKRs for growth and iteration success
- Data-driven decision making frameworks

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

- How will you collect and prioritize user feedback after MVP?
- What metrics will guide your iteration focus?
- What is your planned release cadence post-launch?
- Do you have marketing or growth plans tied to product updates?
- How will you address technical debt over time?

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Filename:** `post-mvp-growth-iteration-plan.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate the document until iteration and growth goals are clear.
2. Ask about feedback loops, release frequency, and growth initiatives.
3. Include strategies for user validation, technical maintenance, and marketing.
4. Align the plan with metrics and success criteria for measurable impact.
