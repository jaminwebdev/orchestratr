# Rule: Generating Testing & QA Strategy Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive **Testing & QA Strategy** document that establishes a robust quality assurance framework covering functional testing, performance validation, security testing, accessibility compliance, and continuous quality monitoring throughout the entire product development lifecycle.

The strategy should provide actionable testing methodologies for QA engineers, automated testing frameworks for developers, quality gates for DevOps teams, and quality metrics for product managers. It must ensure comprehensive coverage while balancing speed, cost, and reliability to maintain exceptional product quality from development through production.
