# Rule: Creating a Comprehensive Market Analysis Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, strategic Market Analysis document in Markdown format that builds upon the previously completed Product Brief (`master-product-brief.md`). The Market Analysis should provide deep insights into market opportunity, competitive dynamics, positioning strategy, and market entry approach.

This document will serve as a critical foundation for strategic decision-making across feature prioritization, product roadmap planning, pricing strategy, go-to-market execution, and investment decisions. It should be accessible to stakeholders at all levels - from product managers and designers to developers, executives, and potential investors.

## Process

1. **Analyze Existing Documentation:** Thoroughly review the `master-product-brief.md` in the `/docs` folder to understand the product vision, target audience, and initial market assumptions.
2. **Identify Knowledge Gaps:** Compare the product brief against the comprehensive market analysis requirements to identify missing information.
3. **Conduct Structured Market Discovery:** Use the enhanced question framework below to gather detailed market intelligence.
4. **Cross-Reference and Validate:** Ensure market findings align with and enhance the product strategy outlined in the product brief.
5. **Generate Comprehensive Market Analysis:** Create a detailed analysis using the enhanced structure below.
6. **Quality Assurance Review:** Ensure the analysis is actionable, evidence-based, and strategically sound.
7. **Save Document:** Save the final document as `market-analysis.md` in the `/docs` directory.
