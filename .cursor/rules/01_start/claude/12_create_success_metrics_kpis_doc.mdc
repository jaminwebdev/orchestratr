# Rule: Generating Analytics & Success Metrics Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive **Analytics & Success Metrics** document that establishes a robust measurement framework for tracking product performance, user behavior, business impact, and strategic objectives. This document serves as the foundation for data-driven decision making, product optimization, and long-term business growth.

This document enables product owners, analysts, developers, marketers, and executives to understand what success looks like, how to measure it accurately, and how to act on insights to drive continuous improvement and business value.

## Process

   - `/docs/user-flows-diagrams.md` - To identify critical conversion points and funnel metrics
   - `/docs/testing-qa-strategy.md` - For quality metrics and performance indicators alignment
   - `/docs/performance-optimization-plan.md` - For technical performance metrics integration
   - `/docs/ux-design-doc.md` - For user experience metrics and interaction tracking
   - `/docs/content-strategy.md` - For content engagement and effectiveness metrics
   - `/docs/architecture-design-patterns.md` - For system health and operational metrics
