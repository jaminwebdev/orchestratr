# Rule: Generating UX & Design Considerations

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a comprehensive **UX & Design Considerations** document that establishes the visual design system, interaction principles, emotional tone, and brand expression framework for the product.

This document serves as the definitive creative and usability brief for UI/UX designers, frontend developers, and content creators, providing clear guidance on visual language, interaction patterns, accessibility standards, and user experience principles that will ensure consistent, user-centered design implementation across all touchpoints.

## Process

### 1. **Comprehensive Documentation Analysis**
   Review and synthesize insights from the following documents in `/docs/`:
   - `master-product-brief.md` - Product vision, target market, competitive positioning, and brand values
   - `user-personas.md` - User demographics, psychographics, technical comfort levels, and aesthetic preferences
   - `features.md` - Feature complexity, interaction patterns, and functional requirements
   - `user-flows.md` - Navigation patterns, decision points, and user journey complexity
   - `market-analysis.md` - Competitive design landscape and industry standards (if available)

### 2. **Design Context & Constraints Assessment**
   Analyze existing documentation for:
   - **Brand personality indicators** from product positioning and messaging
   - **User sophistication levels** from persona technical comfort and usage patterns
   - **Feature complexity requirements** that impact UI density and interaction paradigms
   - **Business constraints** that affect design scope and implementation approach
   - **Competitive differentiation opportunities** in visual and experiential design

### 3. **Strategic Design Questioning**
   Before generating the document, clarify critical design decisions:
   - Visual brand identity and emotional positioning
   - User experience complexity and sophistication level
   - Platform-specific design requirements and constraints
   - Accessibility and inclusive design commitments
   - Technical implementation considerations affecting design choices

### 4. **Comprehensive Design Framework Generation**
   Create a holistic design system that covers:
   - **Visual Identity System** - Colors, typography, iconography, imagery
   - **Interaction Design Principles** - Behavior patterns, feedback systems, navigation
   - **Content Strategy Integration** - Voice, tone, messaging hierarchy
   - **Accessibility & Inclusion Framework** - Universal design principles
   - **Platform & Technical Considerations** - Responsive design, performance impact
   - **Brand Expression Guidelines** - Personality manifestation in UI elements

### 5. **Implementation & Consistency Framework**
   Ensure the document provides:
   - Clear design decision rationale tied to user needs and business goals
   - Specific implementation guidance for designers and developers
   - Quality assurance criteria for design review and validation
   - Integration points with development workflow and style guides

## Advanced Clarifying Questions Framework

### ðŸŽ¨ **Brand Identity & Visual Personality**
- Based on the product brief, what 5-7 adjectives best describe the desired brand personality?
- How should the visual design reflect the product's core value proposition?
- Are there specific brands or products (in any industry) whose visual approach resonates with your vision?
- Should the design feel more premium/professional or accessible/approachable?
- Do you have existing brand assets (logo, colors, fonts) or need a complete visual identity?

### ðŸ‘¥ **User-Centered Design Considerations**
- Given the user personas, what level of visual complexity will resonate best?
- How tech-savvy are the primary users, and how should that influence interface complexity?
- What are the primary emotional states users will be in when using the product?
- Are there cultural or demographic considerations that should influence design choices?
- What accessibility needs are most important based on the user base?

### ðŸ”§ **Functional Design Requirements**
- Which features require the most visual prominence in the interface hierarchy?
- Are there complex data visualization or content presentation needs?
- How important is speed vs. visual richness in the user experience?
- What level of customization or personalization should the design accommodate?
- Are there integration requirements with other tools that affect design consistency?

### ðŸ“± **Platform & Technical Design Strategy**
- What platforms and devices are highest priority for design optimization?
- Should the design system prioritize native platform conventions or custom brand expression?
- Are there performance constraints that limit visual complexity or animation?
- How important is offline functionality, and how should that affect the design approach?
- What browser/device compatibility requirements might impact design choices?

### ðŸŽ¯ **Competitive & Market Positioning**
- Based on market analysis, how should the design differentiate from key competitors?
- Are there industry design conventions that should be followed or deliberately avoided?
- What design trends are most relevant to the target market and user base?
- How can the design support the product's unique value proposition?

## Execution Instructions

1. **DO NOT generate the document immediately** - Begin with comprehensive analysis and strategic questioning
2. **Thoroughly analyze all referenced documentation** to understand user needs, business goals, and technical constraints
3. **Present a strategic design approach** based on documented insights before diving into specifics
4. **Confirm design philosophy and priorities** with the user through targeted questions
5. **Generate comprehensive design guidance** that balances user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility
6. **Ensure practical implementation focus** - every guideline should be actionable for designers and developers
7. **Validate design decisions** against user personas and product objectives throughout the process
8. **Provide clear rationale** for all design recommendations tied to user research and business strategy

## Final Notes


The resulting design document should be comprehensive enough to guide consistent design decisions across the entire product development lifecycle while remaining flexible enough to evolve based on user feedback and technical discoveries. Every design recommendation should clearly connect back to user needs identified in personas and flows, business objectives outlined in the product brief, and technical requirements emerging from the architecture and feature specifications.
