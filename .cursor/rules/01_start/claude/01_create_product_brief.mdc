# Rule: Generating a Comprehensive Product Brief

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, actionable Product Brief in Markdown format that serves as the foundational document for all subsequent project planning. The brief should be comprehensive enough for stakeholders at all levels - from junior developers to senior leadership - to understand the product vision, requirements, and implementation approach.

The generated product brief will serve as the single source of truth and be referenced throughout the entire development lifecycle, including features documentation, user stories, user flows, UX/UI design, content strategy, technical architecture, testing plans, and go-to-market strategy.

## Process

1. **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new app/product idea.
2. **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the comprehensive question framework below to gather all necessary information through multiple rounds of clarifying questions.
3. **Validate Understanding:** Summarize key findings and confirm alignment before proceeding.
4. **Generate Comprehensive Product Brief:** Create a detailed brief using the enhanced structure outlined below.
5. **Review and Refine:** Ensure completeness, clarity, and actionability.
6. **Save Product Brief:** Save as `master-product-brief.md` in the `/docs` directory.
