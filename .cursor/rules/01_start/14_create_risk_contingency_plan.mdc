# Rule: Generating Risk & Contingency Plan Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive **Risk & Contingency Plan** document that identifies potential risks, assesses their impact and likelihood, and outlines mitigation and response strategies to minimize disruptions during product development and operation.

This document should help stakeholders proactively prepare for uncertainties and ensure business continuity.

## Process

1. **Reference Previous Docs:**
   - `master-product-brief.md`
   - `architecture-design-patterns.md`
   - `testing-qa-strategy.md`
   - `performance-optimization-plan.md`
   - `security-compliance-plan.md`

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions (if needed):**
   - What are the main categories of risk relevant to your product (technical, operational, market, legal, security)?
   - Which risks have you already encountered or foresee as most critical?
   - What mitigation strategies are currently planned or in place?
   - What is the escalation and communication plan for incidents?
   - Are there backup or failover systems?
   - How will you monitor and update the risk plan over time?

3. **Generate the Risk & Contingency Plan** using the structure below.

## Recommended Document Structure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Identification
- List of potential risks by category:
  - Technical (e.g., system failures, bugs)
  - Operational (e.g., staffing, process failures)
  - Market (e.g., competition, demand shifts)
  - Security (e.g., data breaches, compliance issues)
  - Legal & Regulatory (e.g., licensing, GDPR)
  - External (e.g., supply chain, natural disasters)

### üîç Risk Assessment
- Impact analysis (high/medium/low)
- Likelihood/probability ratings
- Risk prioritization matrix

### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Preventative measures
- Design and architectural safeguards
- Testing and quality assurance
- Security controls

### üö® Contingency & Response Plans
- Incident response procedures
- Communication and escalation workflows
- Backup, recovery, and failover plans
- Roles and responsibilities during incidents

### üîÑ Monitoring & Review
- Regular risk assessments and updates
- Tools and processes for tracking risks
- Lessons learned and continuous improvement

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

- What are your biggest technical risks and how do you plan to mitigate them?
- How prepared are you for security breaches or data loss?
- What is your incident response and communication plan?
- Do you have backup and disaster recovery procedures?
- How often will you revisit and update the risk plan?

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Filename:** `risk-contingency-plan.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate the document until risk categories and mitigation preferences are clear.
2. Ask detailed questions about risks, responses, and backup plans.
3. Provide actionable, prioritized risk management strategies.
4. Emphasize continuous monitoring and incident readiness.
