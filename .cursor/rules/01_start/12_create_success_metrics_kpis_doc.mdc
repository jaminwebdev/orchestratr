# Rule: Generating Analytics & Success Metrics Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating an **Analytics & Success Metrics** document that defines which metrics, KPIs, and data collection strategies will be used to measure product performance, user behavior, and business impact.

This document should enable product owners, analysts, and developers to track progress and make data-driven decisions.

## Process

1. **Reference Previous Docs:**
   - `master-product-brief.md`
   - `features.md`
   - `user-personas.md`
   - `testing-qa-strategy.md`

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions (if needed):**
   - What are your primary business goals (e.g., user acquisition, engagement, retention, revenue)?
   - Which user actions or events are most important to track?
   - Are there existing analytics platforms you want to use (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude)?
   - What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for success?
   - Do you want to track funnels, cohorts, or custom segments?
   - How frequently should reports be generated and reviewed?

3. **Generate the Analytics & Success Metrics Document** using the structure below.

## Recommended Document Structure

### üéØ Business Goals & Objectives
- Primary goals (growth, retention, revenue, satisfaction)
- How analytics tie into product strategy

### üìä Key Metrics & KPIs
- Acquisition metrics (e.g., new users, sign-ups)
- Activation metrics (e.g., onboarding completion)
- Engagement metrics (e.g., daily/weekly active users, session length)
- Retention and churn rates
- Revenue metrics (e.g., ARPU, LTV, conversion rates)
- Performance metrics (e.g., load time, error rates)

### üîç Event Tracking & Data Collection
- Key user events to track (page views, clicks, purchases)
- User properties and segmentation
- Custom event definitions and attributes
- Data collection methods (client-side, server-side)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Integrations
- Analytics platforms and SDKs
- Tag management (Google Tag Manager or alternatives)
- Data privacy and compliance considerations (cookie consent, GDPR)

### üìÖ Reporting & Dashboards
- Frequency of reporting (real-time, daily, weekly)
- Dashboards and visualization tools
- Alerting on anomalies or KPI drops

### üîÑ Experimentation & A/B Testing
- Plans for running experiments
- Metrics to evaluate success in tests

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

- What are the most important user behaviors to track?
- Do you have preferred analytics tools or platforms?
- How will you measure product/feature success quantitatively?
- Will you track revenue or monetization-related KPIs?
- What frequency and format of reporting do you want?

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/`
- **Filename:** `analytics-success-metrics.md`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate the document until goals and metrics preferences are clear.
2. Ask about tool choices, reporting needs, and critical KPIs.
3. Include details on event tracking and compliance.
4. Be explicit about how metrics align with business objectives.
