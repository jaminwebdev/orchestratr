## Core Rule Template

```markdown
# Rule: [Generating/Creating] [Document Type/Task Name]

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in [generating/creating] a [comprehensive/detailed/strategic] [Document Type] in Markdown format that serves as [primary purpose and role in project]. This document should [synthesize insights from/build upon] [list of prerequisite documents] to create [specific output description] that [directly addresses/informs] [key stakeholders and use cases].

The [document type] will serve as [foundation/reference/guide] for [list of downstream activities/decisions] and should be [accessibility requirement] to [target audience] - from [junior level] to [senior level stakeholders].

## Process

1. **Comprehensive Documentation Review:** Thoroughly analyze all existing documents in `/docs/`:
   - [Extract specific insights from Document A]
   - [Incorporate findings from Document B]
   - [Validate assumptions from Document C]
   - [Identify gaps between documented requirements and [this document] specifications]

2. **Context Documentation Integration:** Review supporting materials in `/library_docs/`:
   - [Reference industry best practices]
   - [Incorporate methodology frameworks]
   - [Apply proven templates and structures]
   - [Validate against established standards]

3. **Strategic [Document Type] Planning:** [Document-specific strategic considerations]:
   - [Key strategic consideration 1]
   - [Key strategic consideration 2]
   - [Key strategic consideration 3]

4. **Structured [Domain] Discovery:** Conduct comprehensive [domain] research through targeted questions
5. **[Document Type] Development:** Create detailed, evidence-based [output] using the enhanced framework
6. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure [output] aligns with and enhances insights from previous documentation
7. **Quality Assurance Review:** Validate [output] for completeness, actionability, and strategic alignment
8. **Save Document:** Output as `[filename].md` in the `/docs/` directory with proper versioning

- [ ] Assumptions are clearly distinguished from validated insights
- [ ] Sources are credible and current
- [ ] [Sample sizes/data quality/research methods] are appropriate for confidence levels
- [ ] Biases and limitations are acknowledged

## Integration with Existing Documentation

```

## Key Blueprint Patterns

### 1. **Hierarchical Document Dependencies**
Each rule explicitly builds upon previous documentation, creating a sequential knowledge-building approach.

### 2. **Dual Information Sources**
- `/docs/` - Previously generated project documentation
- `/library_docs/` - Supporting best practices and methodologies

### 3. **Discovery-First Approach**
Never generate immediately; always conduct thorough discovery through structured questioning.

### 4. **Quality Assurance Framework**
Multi-dimensional validation covering completeness, strategic alignment, actionability, and research quality.

### 5. **Cross-Reference Integration**
Explicit validation and integration with all prerequisite documentation.

### 6. **Stakeholder-Agnostic Output**
Documents designed to serve multiple audience levels and use cases.

## Customization Variables

When creating a new rule, customize these elements:

- **Document Type:** (e.g., Technical Architecture, Content Strategy, Testing Plan)
- **Domain Categories:** (e.g., for UX: Information Architecture, Interaction Design, Visual Design)
- **Discovery Questions:** (Domain-specific question frameworks)
- **Structure Sections:** (Document-specific content organization)
- **Quality Checks:** (Domain-relevant validation criteria)
- **Prerequisite Documents:** (Which documents this builds upon)
- **Output Specifications:** (Filename, length, audience)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the blueprint template**
2. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with domain-specific content
3. **Customize discovery questions** for your specific domain
4. **Adapt the document structure** to match your output requirements
5. **Modify quality assurance checks** to reflect domain-specific criteria
6. **Update integration requirements** based on prerequisite documents

7. **Test with your AI agent** to ensure proper functionality
