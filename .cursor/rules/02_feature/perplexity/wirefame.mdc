# Rule: Generating an Optimal Web Page Wireframe

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a clear, effective wireframe for a web page, based on an initial user prompt. The wireframe can be delivered as either a visual mockup/sketch or a structured text outline with sequentially listed sections and descriptions, according to the user’s preference. The wireframe should prioritize usability, clarity, and conversion, following established design principles (such as Gestalt, proximity, hierarchy), and should emphasize calls-to-action (CTAs) where appropriate.

The wireframe must align with the page’s primary and secondary objectives, address the needs of the target user persona, and incorporate the latest research and best practices relevant to the specific page type or niche whenever possible.

## Process

1. **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description of the intended page, its purpose, and any relevant context.
    
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before generating the wireframe, the AI _must_ ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail about:
    
    - The primary objective of the page (e.g., lead generation, e-commerce, information, etc.)
        
    - Any secondary goals (e.g., newsletter signup, social sharing)
        
    - The target user persona, in the format:  
        “[Name] is a [characteristics/descriptor] who needs [user need] because [why/insight].”  
        _Example: “Drew is a pet owner in a small town who needs to find and schedule a dog walker because they work the night shift.”_
        
    - The main problem or pain point the page should address
        
    - Any must-have features, content, or sections
        
    - The preferred wireframe format (visual mockup/sketch or text outline)
        
    - Any reference sites or inspiration
        
    - Brand/style guidelines to follow
        
3. **Research Best Practices:** Based on the information provided, the AI should research and reference the latest best practices and findings for wireframe structures relevant to the page’s goals, audience, and industry/niche. If no specific research exists, apply general web design and UX principles.
    
4. **Draft Wireframe:** Generate the wireframe in the user’s preferred format:
    
    - **Visual Mockup/Sketch:** Provide a simple, annotated sketch or mockup (using ASCII, text-based diagrams, or linking to a tool if possible).
        
    - **Text Outline:** List sections sequentially, each with a brief description of its purpose, content, and any special design considerations.
        
5. **Apply Design Principles:** Ensure the wireframe adheres to:
    
    - **Gestalt principles:** Group related elements, establish clear hierarchy, and use visual cues for relationships.
        
    - **Proximity & Spacing:** Place related items together and use whitespace for clarity.
        
    - **Hierarchy:** Prioritize information visually, with clear headings and section order.
        
    - **Emphasis on CTAs:** Highlight primary and secondary CTAs using placement, size, and contrast.
        
6. **Suggest Improvements:** Recommend enhancements based on research, such as optimal section order, additional trust-building elements, or improved CTA placement.
    
7. **Save Wireframe:** Save the wireframe as wireframe-[page-name].md (for text) or wireframe-[page-name].sketch (for visual) inside the /wireframes directory.
    

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

- **Primary Objective:**  
    “What is the main goal of this page (e.g., sell a product, collect leads, inform users)?”
    
- **Secondary Goals:**  
    “Are there any secondary goals for this page?”
    
- **User Persona:**  
    “Who is the primary user? Please provide a persona in the format:  
    [Name] is a [characteristics/descriptor] who needs [user need] because [why/insight].”
    
- **Problem Statement:**  
    “What problem or pain point does this page address for the user?”
    
- **Must-Have Sections:**  
    “Are there any specific sections or features you want included (e.g., testimonials, pricing table, FAQ)?”
    
- **Preferred Format:**  
    “Do you prefer a visual mockup/sketch or a text outline of the wireframe?”
    
- **Reference Sites:**  
    “Are there any websites or pages you admire or want to use as inspiration?”
    
- **Brand Guidelines:**  
    “Are there specific brand or style guidelines to follow?”
    
- **Content Requirements:**  
    “Is there any existing content, imagery, or copy that must be included?”
    

## Wireframe Structure

The generated wireframe should include (as applicable):

1. **Header:**  
    Logo, navigation, and possibly a top CTA.
    
2. **Hero Section:**  
    Main headline, supporting text, and primary CTA.
    
3. **Problem/Pain Point:**  
    Briefly state the user’s problem or need.
    
4. **Solution/Value Proposition:**  
    How the product/service/page addresses the problem.
    
5. **Key Benefits/Features:**  
    Bulleted or sectioned highlights of main offerings.
    
6. **Social Proof/Trust Elements:**  
    Testimonials, reviews, trust badges, or partner logos.
    
7. **Supporting Content:**  
    Additional information, images, or explainer sections.
    
8. **Secondary CTAs:**  
    For users not ready to convert (e.g., “Learn More,” “Download Guide”).
    
9. **FAQ/Objection Handling:**  
    Address common concerns or questions.
    
10. **Footer:**  
    Contact info, links, legal disclaimers.
    

_Emphasize CTA buttons in strategic locations and use visual hierarchy to guide the user’s attention._

## Best Practices Checklist

- Apply **Gestalt principles** (proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, figure/ground) for grouping and layout.
    
- Use **visual hierarchy** to prioritize information.
    
- Place **primary CTA** above the fold and repeat as needed.
    
- Ensure **logical section order** based on user journey and conversion flow.
    
- Use **ample whitespace** for clarity and focus.
    
- Group related elements and use consistent spacing.
    
- Reference **latest research** and high-performing examples where possible.
    
- Adapt structure for **mobile responsiveness** and accessibility.
    

## Target Audience

Assume the primary user is a **potential customer or user** with specific needs and goals. The wireframe should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and designed to guide the user toward the primary objective.

## Output

- **Format:**
    
    - Markdown (.md) for text outlines
        
    - Sketch/mockup file or annotated ASCII/text diagram for visuals
        
- **Location:** /wireframes/
    
- **Filename:** wireframe-[page-name].md or wireframe-[page-name].sketch
    

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT generate a wireframe until all clarifying questions are answered.
    
2. Ask for the user persona, objectives, and format preference.
    
3. Research and apply the latest best practices for the given page type and goals.
    
4. Generate the wireframe in the requested format, applying all design and UX principles.
    

5. Save the wireframe file and flag any recommended improvements or research findings for further review.
