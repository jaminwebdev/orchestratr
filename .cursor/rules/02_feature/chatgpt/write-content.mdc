# Rule: Generating Persuasive Web Page Copy

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in crafting persuasive, high-converting web page copy in Markdown format, tailored to a specific user persona and business goal. The copy must follow proven frameworks (e.g. PAS, AIDA), use conversational and emotionally resonant language, and reflect modern best practices in web marketing.

The output should reflect the voice and values of the brand, include strong CTAs (Calls to Action), and follow a logical page flow suitable for wireframing or development.

## Process

1. **Receive Initial Prompt**  
    The user provides a short description of the page’s purpose, intended audience, and what product/service/idea it’s promoting.
    
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**  
    The AI _must_ ask questions to gather sufficient details for writing emotionally resonant, relevant, and high-impact copy. The goal is to deeply understand the target user, page structure, and conversion goal.
    
3. **Request Persona Format**  
    Request the user to define the persona in the following format:
    
    > `[Name] is a [occupation/descriptor] who wants [thing] so that [desired outcome].`  
    > Optionally request a secondary persona if relevant.
    
4. **Request Page Outline or Wireframe**  
    Ask for either a text-based outline of the page sections, or a screenshot of the wireframe (which can be described or uploaded). This will guide the structure of the final copy.
    
5. **Apply Persuasion Frameworks**  
    Use AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution), or other frameworks (e.g. FAB: Features, Advantages, Benefits) where appropriate in different sections.
    
6. **Write Conversational, Action-Oriented Copy**  
    Favor short sentences, high emotional value, active voice, and vivid language. Use power words, rhetorical questions, and language that builds trust and credibility.
    
7. **Tailor for Scannability and Conversion**  
    Use headlines, subheadings, short paragraphs, bulleted lists, and strong CTAs to improve readability and flow. Each section should move the user closer to taking action.
    
8. **Review Tone, Message, and Fit**  
    Ensure the copy aligns with the persona, business goal, and outlined page structure. Tone should reflect the brand (e.g., professional, bold, friendly, inspiring).
    
9. **Generate Output**  
    Provide the final copy in Markdown format, sectioned according to the wireframe or best-practice layout (e.g., Hero > Problem > Solution > Testimonials > CTA).
    

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions to the prompt, but may include:

- **Who is the target persona?**  
    "Can you provide a quick persona using this format: `[Name] is a [descriptor] who wants [thing] so that [outcome]`?"
    
- **What is the page's primary goal?**  
    "Is the goal to capture leads, sell a product, get signups, schedule demos, or something else?"
    
- **What action do you want the user to take?**  
    "What is the primary CTA? (e.g., Book a demo, Subscribe, Buy now)"
    
- **What's the value proposition?**  
    "What makes this offer/product/service unique or better than alternatives?"
    
- **What emotional or practical problem does the user face?**  
    "What frustration, fear, or desire does this copy need to speak to?"
    
- **What stage of awareness is the user in?**  
    "Is the audience problem-aware, solution-aware, or product-aware?"
    
- **Are there testimonials, stats, or proof points to include?**  
    "Do you have social proof (testimonials, logos, stats) you'd like to feature?"
    
- **Do you have a preferred tone or writing style?**  
    "Should the tone be friendly, confident, humorous, minimalist, or something else?"
    
- **Do you have a wireframe?**  
    "Can you provide a text outline of the page’s layout or upload a wireframe?"
    

## Page Copy Structure

The AI will organize the copy into sections based on the wireframe or use the default layout below:

1. **Hero Section**
    - Clear, bold headline (benefit-driven)
    - Subheadline with unique value proposition
    - Primary CTA (e.g., “Try it free,” “Book a demo”)
2. **Problem/Agitation (PAS)**
    - Describe the user’s pain point(s)
    - Emphasize emotional stakes or consequences
3. **Solution/Benefit (PAS)**
    - Introduce the product or service
    - Highlight key outcomes or transformations
4. **Key Features or Differentiators (FAB)**
    - List 3–5 main features with benefits
    - Use icons or bullets for scannability
5. **Social Proof / Trust Signals**
    - Testimonials, ratings, trust logos, case studies
6. **Objection Handling (Optional)**
    - Address common questions or concerns
    - Include mini-FAQ if relevant
7. **Final CTA**
    - Reiterate action with urgency or incentive
    - Use direct, emotionally charged copy
8. **SEO Meta / Summary Copy (Optional)**
    - Provide a short meta description or OpenGraph summary for the page

## Target Audience

Assume the primary user of this rule is a **marketer, designer, or founder** preparing to launch a new product, page, or campaign. The AI should generate compelling and practical web copy suitable for direct use or light editing.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/web-copy/`
- **Filename:** `copy-[page-name].md`
- **Sectioned:** With clear H2s for each content block
## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT begin writing copy until persona and outline/wireframe are provided.
2. Ask clarifying questions to understand the user’s goals and audience deeply.
3. Choose the best-fit persuasion framework for the page.
4. Write concise, high-impact copy that reflects the desired tone and outcome.

5. Save the Markdown file in `/web-copy/` using `copy-[page-name].md`.
