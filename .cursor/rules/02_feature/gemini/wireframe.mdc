# Rule: Generating a Web Page Wireframe

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a structural wireframe for a web page, either as a textual outline or a simplified visual sketch, based on user input. The wireframe should adhere to fundamental design principles such as Gestalt principles, visual hierarchy, and optimal CTA placement. It should also incorporate research-backed best practices for various page types, ensuring an effective and user-centered design.

## Process

1. **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a web page wireframe.
    
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before creating the wireframe, the AI _must_ ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail about the page's purpose, target audience, and desired output format.
    
3. **Determine Output Format:** Confirm with the user whether they prefer a text-based outline with descriptions or a conceptual visual sketch (mockup).
    
4. **Analyze User Needs & Goals:** Based on the user's input, identify the core problem statement, user persona, and page objectives. This information is crucial for designing a user-centric wireframe.
    
5. **Research Best Practices & Patterns:** Based on the **primary page goal** and **page type** (e.g., e-commerce product page, blog post, landing page, "About Us" page, contact form), research and identify industry-standard wireframe structures, common eye-tracking patterns (F-pattern for text-heavy, Z-pattern for visually driven), and design conventions for optimal user experience and conversions. If specific research for the given niche/page type isn't readily available, rely on general UX/UI best practices.
    
6. **Apply Design Principles:** Consciously apply the following principles to the wireframe:
    
    - **Gestalt Principles:**
        - **Proximity:** Group related elements together (e.g., a form field and its label, navigation items, content blocks). Use whitespace to define distinct sections.
        - **Similarity:** Use consistent visual cues (e.g., same size for clickable elements of similar function, similar placeholder shapes for images).
        - **Continuity:** Guide the user's eye along a logical path (e.g., through clear vertical flow, consistent alignment).
        - **Closure:** Allow for implied shapes or groups, reducing visual clutter where appropriate.
        - **Figure-Ground:** Clearly distinguish foreground elements (e.g., content, CTAs) from the background.
        - **Focal Point:** Use size, contrast, or isolation to draw attention to key elements, especially primary CTAs.
    - **Visual Hierarchy:** Establish a clear order of importance for elements through:
        - **Size:** Larger elements draw more attention (e.g., headline vs. body text, primary CTA).
        - **Placement:** Important elements "above the fold" and in natural eye-tracking paths (F-pattern, Z-pattern).
        - **Contrast:** Use varying shades of gray (in wireframes) or different line weights to emphasize elements.
        - **Whitespace:** Use ample whitespace around important elements to make them stand out.
        - **Typography (simulated):** Indicate different text weights (bold, regular) and sizes for headings, subheadings, and body copy.
    - **Emphasis on CTAs:**
        - **Prominence:** Make primary CTAs visually distinct (e.g., larger block, central placement, dedicated space).
        - **Repetition:** Consider repeating primary CTAs at strategic points after sufficient information has been presented.
        - **Clarity:** The CTA text should be direct and action-oriented.
        - **Thumb-friendliness (for mobile):** Ensure interactive elements (buttons, links) are large enough for easy tapping.
7. **Generate Wireframe:** Based on the gathered information, research, and applied principles, create the wireframe.
    
    - **For Text-based:** Provide a sequential list of sections with descriptive placeholders for content and elements.
    - **For Sketch/Mockup:** Describe the visual layout using simple shapes, blocks, and textual labels for elements. Focus on structure, placement, and hierarchy, not final aesthetics.
8. **Suggest Considerations:** Provide additional recommendations for the next steps in the design process (e.g., adding high-fidelity details, conducting user testing, implementing responsive design considerations).
    
9. **Save Wireframe:** Save the generated document as `wireframe-[page-name].[md/txt]` inside the `/design/wireframes` directory.
    

## Clarifying Questions

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are the mandatory questions to explore:

- **Page Name/Title:** "What is the name or title of this page?"
- **Primary Objective:** "What is the **primary objective** of this page? (e.g., collect user emails, sell a specific product, provide information about a service, allow users to sign up for an account)"
- **Secondary Goal (Optional):** "Is there a **secondary goal** for this page?"
- **Target User Persona:** "Please describe the **primary user persona** for this page in the format: [Name] is a [characteristics/descriptor] who needs [user need] because [why/insight]." (Example: _Drew is a pet owner in a small town who needs to find and schedule a dog walker because they work the night shift._)
- **Current State:** "Is this a brand new page, or is it a redesign/update of an existing page? If existing, what are its current strengths and weaknesses?"
- **Key Content/Information:** "What are the essential pieces of content or information that _must_ be present on this page?"
- **Call to Action (CTA):** "What is the desired **primary Call to Action (CTA)**? (e.g., 'Sign Up Now', 'Buy This Product', 'Learn More'). Are there any secondary CTAs?"
- **Input Method Preference:** "Would you prefer the wireframe as a **text file with sections listed sequentially** or as a **conceptual sketch/mockup description**?"
- **Any Existing Components/Patterns:** "Are there any existing design system components, navigation patterns, or visual elements from other parts of the website/application that should be consistent here?"
- **Reference Pages (Optional):** "Do you have any examples of pages (competitors, inspirations) that you like the structure or flow of?"
- **Mobile-First or Desktop-First:** "Should this wireframe prioritize a **mobile-first** approach (designing for smaller screens first) or a **desktop-first** approach?"

## Wireframe Structure (Examples - adapted based on user choice)

## Target Audience

The primary recipient of this wireframe is a **UX/UI Designer, Front-End Developer, or Stakeholder** who needs a clear structural guide for the page. The wireframe should be explicit about content placement, hierarchy, and user flow, while remaining high-level in terms of aesthetics.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`) or Plain Text (`.txt`) based on user choice.
- **Location:** `/design/wireframes/`
- **Filename:** `wireframe-[page-name].[md/txt]`

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start generating the wireframe until all clarifying questions are answered.
2. Prioritize understanding the **primary objective, user persona, and desired output format.**
3. **Research best practices** for the identified page type and apply them to the wireframe structure.
4. Consciously apply **Gestalt principles, visual hierarchy, and CTA emphasis** throughout the wireframe, making these decisions explicit in the descriptive text/sketch.
5. Generate the wireframe in the chosen format, ensuring clarity and focus on **structure and flow**.

6. Save the wireframe file and suggest further design steps.
