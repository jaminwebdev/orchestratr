# Rule: Creating a Comprehensive Audience Research Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, strategic Audience Research document in Markdown format that builds upon the previously completed Website Brief (`website-brief.md`). The Audience Research should provide deep insights into target audiences, user behaviors, market dynamics, and positioning opportunities specific to website strategy.

This document will serve as a critical foundation for strategic decision-making across site structure, content strategy, UX design, conversion optimization, and marketing approach. It should be accessible to stakeholders at all levels - from designers and developers to marketers, business owners, and potential partners.

## Process

1. **Analyze Existing Documentation:** Thoroughly review the `website-brief.md` in the `/docs` folder to understand the website purpose, initial target audience assumptions, and business objectives.
2. **Identify Knowledge Gaps:** Compare the website brief against comprehensive audience research requirements to identify missing information.
3. **Conduct Structured Audience Discovery:** Use the enhanced question framework below to gather detailed audience intelligence.
4. **Cross-Reference and Validate:** Ensure audience findings align with and enhance the website strategy outlined in the website brief.
5. **Generate Comprehensive Audience Research:** Create a detailed analysis using the structure below.
6. **Quality Assurance Review:** Ensure the research is actionable, evidence-based, and strategically sound.
7. **Save Document:** Save the final document as `audience-research.md` in the `/docs` directory.
