# Rule: Multi-Page Wireframe Generation via Document Integration & Research

## Purpose
Guide the AI to generate comprehensive, evidence-based wireframes for multiple website pages by:
- **Leveraging existing project documentation** from previous workflow steps
- Conducting targeted interviews to clarify wireframe-specific requirements
- Integrating best practices from `/wireframe_best_practices.md`, `wireframe_101.md`, and `wireframe_examples.md` in the .cursor\rules\site\research_docs directory
- Producing a complete wireframe set with rationale, research citations, and implementation guidance
- Creating consistent, conversion-optimized layouts across all key pages

## Document Integration Prerequisites

### Required Previous Documents
Before beginning wireframe generation, ensure these documents exist in the /docs/ directory and are accessible:

**1. Website Brief (`website_brief.md`)**
- Business objectives and conversion goals
- Brand guidelines and design constraints
- Technical requirements and platform specifications
- Budget and timeline considerations

**2. Audience Research (`audience_research.md`)**
- Detailed user personas with behavioral patterns
- User journey mapping and touchpoint analysis
- Device preferences and technical capabilities
- Pain points and motivation drivers

**3. Sitemap Document (`sitemap_document.md`)**
- Complete site structure and navigation hierarchy
- Content organization and page relationships
- SEO strategy and URL structure
- User flow optimization decisions

### Document Analysis Protocol

#### Step 1: Extract Wireframe-Critical Information

**From Website Brief:**
```
Extract for wireframing:
- Primary conversion goals → CTA strategy across pages
- Brand personality → Visual hierarchy and tone
- Technical constraints → Layout limitations and requirements
- Success metrics → Elements that support measurement
- Content strategy → Information architecture priorities
```

**From Audience Research:**
```
Extract for wireframing:
- User personas → Page-specific user needs and behaviors
- Device preferences → Responsive design priorities
- User journey stages → Content and CTA placement strategies
- Pain points → Friction reduction opportunities
- Behavioral patterns → Layout and interaction design decisions
```

**From Sitemap Document:**
```
Extract for wireframing:
- Page hierarchy → Navigation design consistency
- Content categories → Template requirements
- User flow paths → Cross-page journey optimization
- Conversion funnels → Multi-page CTA strategy
- SEO considerations → Content structure requirements
```

#### Step 2: Identify Priority Pages for Wireframing

Based on sitemap and business objectives, determine:
- **Tier 1 (MVP/Launch Critical)**: Homepage, primary conversion pages, key landing pages
- **Tier 2 (Phase 2)**: Secondary pages, support content, specialized functionality
- **Tier 3 (Future Enhancement)**: Advanced features, niche content, expansion pages

## Enhanced Interview Process

### Pre-Interview Document Synthesis
Before asking questions, create integrated brief showing:
- **User Journey → Page Requirements**: Which pages serve which journey stages
- **Business Goal → Page Function**: How each priority page supports conversion objectives
- **Content Strategy → Layout Needs**: What content types need accommodation
- **Technical Constraints → Design Limitations**: Platform-specific wireframe considerations

### Targeted Wireframe Interview

**Ask only questions NOT answered in existing documentation:**

#### Page Prioritization & Scope
- Based on your timeline of [X months from brief], which pages are essential for launch vs. future phases?
- Your conversion goal is [goal from brief] - which pages are most critical to this objective?
- The sitemap shows [X pages] - should we wireframe all Tier 1 pages or focus on a subset?

#### Device & Responsive Strategy
- Your audience research shows [device preference] - should we design mobile-first or desktop-first?
- Are there page-specific device considerations? (e.g., mobile-heavy landing pages vs. desktop-heavy dashboards)
- Do any pages require device-specific functionality or layouts?

#### Content & Asset Availability
- For the priority pages, what content assets do you currently have vs. need to create?
- Are there specific images, videos, or interactive elements planned for key pages?
- Do you have existing brand assets (logos, imagery, testimonials) we should incorporate?

#### Conversion & CTA Strategy
- Based on your user journey mapping, what should be the primary CTA on each key page?
- Should CTAs be consistent across pages or vary based on journey stage?
- Are there secondary actions you want to enable on each page type?

#### Integration & Functionality Requirements
- The brief mentions [technical integrations] - do these affect specific page layouts?
- Are there forms, calculators, or interactive elements needed on priority pages?
- Do any pages require special functionality (filtering, search, user accounts)?

#### Brand & Design Constraints
- Are there brand elements that must appear consistently across all pages?
- Do different page types need different design approaches while maintaining consistency?
- Are there accessibility requirements beyond standard WCAG compliance?
