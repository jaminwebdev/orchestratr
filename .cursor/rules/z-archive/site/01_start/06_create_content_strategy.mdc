# Rule: Creating Comprehensive Content Strategy Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, strategic Content Strategy document in Markdown format that builds upon all previously completed website documentation and incorporates proven copywriting best practices. The Content Strategy should establish the framework for creating, organizing, delivering, and maintaining all content across the website ecosystem that directly supports user journeys, conversion goals, and brand positioning identified in earlier strategic phases.

This document will serve as the definitive content creation and management guide for copywriters, content creators, designers, and developers, ensuring that every piece of content‚Äîfrom headlines and microcopy to error messages and help documentation‚Äîis strategically aligned with user needs, business objectives, and conversion optimization principles.

## Process

   - `sitemaps-document.md` - Site structure, content organization, and navigation content requirements
   - `wireframes-document.md` - Content hierarchy, layout constraints, and interface copy placement
   - `ux-design-considerations.md` - Brand voice foundations, design-content integration, and user experience content requirements

2. **Integrate Copywriting Best Practices:** Review and incorporate insights from `/research_docs/`:

   - Content hierarchy needs derived from site structure and user flow priorities
   - Design-content integration requirements from UX considerations

4. **Conduct Targeted Content Discovery:** Using enhanced questions to fill content-specific gaps not addressed in previous documentation

5. **Validate Content Strategy Integration:** Ensure content recommendations directly support:
   - Conversion paths and business objectives from the website brief
   - User information needs and communication preferences from audience research
   - Content organization and hierarchy from sitemaps and wireframes
   - Brand expression and user experience goals from design considerations

6. **Generate Integrated Content Framework:** Create comprehensive content strategy that references and builds upon complete website strategy

7. **Quality Assurance Review:** Verify content strategy enhances and aligns with all previous strategic decisions

8. **Save Document:** Save as `content-strategy.md` in the `/docs` directory
