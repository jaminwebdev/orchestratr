# Rule: Integrated Wireframe & Content Generation (Evidence-Based)

## Purpose
Guide the AI to create conversion-optimized web pages through a unified process that:
- Conducts a comprehensive interactive interview to gather context
- Integrates research from wireframe docs (wireframe_best_practices.md, wireframe_101.md, wireframe_examples.md) and copy docs (copy_best_practices.md, copy_ctas.md, copy_headlines.md)
- Produces a cohesive wireframe-content deliverable optimized for conversion
- Provides clear rationale backed by research and best practices

## Integrated Process Flow

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Discovery Interview

**Ask strategic questions in logical groupings:**

#### Project Context & Goals
- What is the primary goal of this page? (lead generation, sales, information, etc.)
- What are your key success metrics? (conversion rate, engagement, etc.)
- Does an existing wireframe exist? If yes, provide the file location.
- What type of page is this? (homepage, product, landing, service, about, etc.)

#### User & Audience Analysis
- Who is your primary user? (Format: "[Name] is a [descriptor] who needs [need] because [why]")
- Are there secondary user personas? Briefly describe.
- What stage of the buyer's journey are they in? (awareness, consideration, decision)
- How will users find this page? (paid ads, organic search, email, social, direct)
- What device(s) do they primarily use? (mobile-first, desktop-primary, mixed)

#### Product/Service & Differentiation
- What specific product/service does this page promote?
- What makes your offering unique? (top 2-3 differentiators)
- What are the main user pain points or objections you need to address?
- What's the primary value proposition in one sentence?

#### Content & Assets
- What existing content assets do you have? (testimonials, case studies, product images, videos)
- What tone/personality should the copy reflect? (professional, friendly, authoritative, etc.)
- Are there any industry-specific compliance or trust requirements?
- What SEO keywords or phrases should be incorporated?

#### Technical & Brand Constraints
- Are there brand guidelines, visual constraints, or technical limitations?
- Any accessibility requirements or performance considerations?
- Integration needs with other systems (CRM, analytics, etc.)?

### Phase 2: Strategic Synthesis & Research Integration

**Synthesize user input into a structured brief:**
- Primary user persona and context
- Conversion goal hierarchy (primary + secondary)
- Page type and user journey stage
- Content strategy and messaging framework
- Technical and brand requirements

**Research Integration:**
- Reference wireframe docs for structural best practices
- Reference copy docs for messaging and conversion optimization
- Cite specific research for major structural and content decisions
- Note when recommendations are based on general principles vs. specific studies

### Phase 3: Unified Structure & Content Generation

#### If Existing Wireframe Provided:
- Review and assess the existing wireframe structure
- Suggest optimizations based on research and user context
- Generate content that aligns with the wireframe sections
- Annotate with rationale for any structural modifications

#### If No Existing Wireframe:
- Create optimal page structure based on page type, user journey, and research
- Integrate content strategy into the structural decisions
- Design with mobile-first principles and conversion optimization

### Phase 4: Integrated Deliverable Creation

**Generate a unified markdown document containing:**

#### Executive Summary
- User persona and context
- Primary conversion goal and success metrics
- Key strategic decisions and rationale

#### Wireframe Structure with Integrated Content

For each section, provide:
- **Structure**: ASCII mockup or detailed layout description
- **Content**: Headlines, copy, CTAs written for that section
- **Rationale**: Why this section exists and is placed here
- **Research Citations**: Specific references to supporting documentation
- **Alternatives**: Key variations for testing (headlines, CTAs, layout options)

**Example Section Format:**
```
## Section: Hero Area

### Structure
+----------------------------------+
|         [LOGO]    [NAVIGATION]   |
+----------------------------------+
|                                  |
|      [PRIMARY HEADLINE]         |
|      Supporting subheadline      |
|      Brief value proposition     |
|        [PRIMARY CTA]             |
|      [Hero Image/Video Area]     |
|                                  |
+----------------------------------+

### Content
**Primary Headline:** "Transform Your Business in 30 Days"
**Alternative Headlines:** 
- "Get Results in 30 Days or Your Money Back"
- "The Fastest Way to [Specific Outcome]"

**Subheadline:** "Join 10,000+ companies who've streamlined their operations and increased productivity by 40%"

**Primary CTA:** "Start Your Free Trial"
**Alternative CTAs:** "Get Started Today" | "See How It Works"

### Rationale
- Hero follows F-pattern reading (wireframe_best_practices.md)
- Headline uses benefit-focused approach (copy_headlines.md)
- CTA uses action-oriented language (copy_ctas.md)
- Above-fold placement ensures visibility (wireframe_101.md)

### Mobile Considerations
- Hero text scales responsively
- CTA button minimum 44px touch target
- Hero image optimized for mobile viewports
```

#### Conversion Optimization Integration
- **CTA Strategy**: Primary and secondary CTA placement throughout
- **Social Proof**: Strategic testimonial and trust signal placement
- **User Flow**: Logical progression from awareness to conversion
- **Friction Reduction**: Minimize cognitive load and decision points

#### Testing & Optimization Recommendations
- A/B testing opportunities for high-impact elements
- Suggested variations for headlines, CTAs, and key sections
- Performance tracking recommendations

### Phase 5: Implementation Guidance

**Provide actionable next steps:**
- Priority order for implementation
- Technical specifications for developers
- Content guidelines for ongoing optimization
- Success metrics and testing timeline

## Design Principles Integration

### Unified UX/Copy Approach
- **Gestalt Principles**: Applied to both layout and content hierarchy
- **Conversion Psychology**: Integrated into structural and copy decisions
- **Accessibility**: Built into both wireframe and content recommendations
- **Mobile Optimization**: Structure and content optimized for mobile-first experience

### Research-Driven Decisions
- **Wireframe Research**: Structure based on user behavior studies and conversion data
- **Copy Research**: Content based on psychological triggers and conversion testing
- **Industry Best Practices**: Sector-specific patterns and compliance requirements
- **Cross-Functional Optimization**: Decisions that optimize both UX and conversion

## Quality Assurance Checklist

2. Full Page Wireframe with Integrated Content (section by section)
3. Conversion Optimization Strategy
4. Testing & Optimization Recommendations
5. Implementation Guidelines

**File Naming Convention:** `[page-type]_[client-name]_wireframe-content_[date].md`
