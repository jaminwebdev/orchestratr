# Rule: Generating Comprehensive User Personas

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating detailed, research-based User Personas in Markdown format that serve as the foundational user representation for all product development decisions. These personas should synthesize insights from the `master-product-brief.md` and `market-analysis.md` documents to create actionable user archetypes that inform UX design, feature prioritization, content strategy, marketing messaging, and development decisions.

User personas should be grounded in real user research and market insights, providing sufficient depth and specificity to guide decision-making across all team roles - from designers and developers to product managers and marketers. Each persona should feel like a real person with authentic motivations, behaviors, and constraints.

## Process

1. **Comprehensive Document Review:** Thoroughly analyze existing documentation in the `/docs/` directory:
   - Review `master-product-brief.md` for target audience definitions, user needs, and product goals
   - Extract user insights from `market-analysis.md` including customer segments, behavior patterns, and market research
   - Identify gaps between documented user assumptions and detailed persona requirements

2. **User Research Synthesis:** Compile and analyze all available user research data:
   - Customer interviews and surveys
   - Market research findings
   - Competitive user analysis
   - Behavioral analytics data
   - Support ticket patterns

3. **Strategic Persona Planning:** Determine persona strategy:
   - Primary personas (2-3 core user types that drive 80% of product decisions)
   - Secondary personas (important but less frequent user types)
   - Anti-personas (users the product should NOT target)
   - Persona relationships and interactions

4. **Structured User Discovery:** Conduct comprehensive user research through targeted questions
5. **Persona Development:** Create detailed, evidence-based personas using the enhanced framework
6. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure personas align with and enhance insights from previous documentation
7. **Quality Assurance Review:** Validate personas for completeness, actionability, and strategic alignment
8. **Save Document:** Output as `user-personas.md` in the `/docs/` folder with proper versioning
