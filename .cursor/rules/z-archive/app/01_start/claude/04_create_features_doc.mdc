# Rule: Creating a Comprehensive Features Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in generating a detailed, strategically prioritized Features Document in Markdown format that serves as the definitive feature specification for the entire product development lifecycle. This document should synthesize insights from the Product Brief, Market Analysis, and User Personas to create a comprehensive feature roadmap that directly addresses user needs, market opportunities, and business objectives.

The features document will serve as the foundation for user stories, user flows, wireframes, technical architecture, testing strategies, and development sprints. Each feature should be detailed enough to guide implementation decisions while remaining accessible to all team members - from junior developers and designers to product managers and stakeholders.

## Process

1. **Comprehensive Documentation Review:** Thoroughly analyze all existing documents in `/docs/`:
   - Extract feature requirements and priorities from `master-product-brief.md`
   - Incorporate competitive insights and market opportunities from `market-analysis.md`
   - Align features with user needs and behaviors from `user-personas.md`
   - Identify gaps between documented requirements and comprehensive feature specifications

2. **Strategic Feature Mapping:** Create strategic alignment between features and business objectives:
   - Map features to user persona needs and pain points
   - Align features with competitive positioning and market differentiation
   - Prioritize features based on business value and user impact
   - Consider technical dependencies and implementation complexity

3. **Feature Discovery & Validation:** Conduct structured feature exploration:
   - Validate core feature assumptions against user research
   - Identify missing features critical for user success
   - Explore integration and ecosystem requirements
   - Consider accessibility, security, and compliance features

4. **Prioritization Framework Application:** Apply systematic prioritization methodology:
   - Business value assessment
   - User impact analysis
   - Technical complexity evaluation
   - Market timing considerations
   - Resource requirement estimation

5. **Comprehensive Feature Specification:** Develop detailed feature descriptions with full context
6. **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure feature alignment with all previous documentation
7. **Quality Assurance Review:** Validate completeness, clarity, and strategic alignment
8. **Save Document:** Output as `features.md` in the `/docs/` directory
