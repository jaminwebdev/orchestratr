# 100 High-Performing CTA Examples by Category

Effective calls-to-action (CTAs) combine clear action verbs, urgency, and benefits to motivate clicks. Below are **100 unique CTAs** organized by category and copywriting technique. Each category includes both short button text (1–6 words) and supporting headlines or subheadings (short one-liners). Examples draw on copy frameworks like AIDA/PAS and UX best practices (e.g. using strong verbs, keeping CTAs concise, and invoking urgency or benefits). Where available, conversion data (A/B test results and statistics) support each approach. Use these as inspiration or “swipe” copy for your own campaigns.

## Urgency/Scarcity CTAs

Urgency taps **FOMO** (“fear of missing out”) and triggers fast action. Time-oriented wording and limited offers can boost clicks. These CTAs often use countdown language or scarcity:

* “Act Now”
* “Limited Time Only”
* “Last Chance”
* “Sale Ends Soon”
* “Only 24 Hours Left—Buy Now”
* “Just a Few Left—Hurry Up!”
* *Heading:* “Hurry—Offer Ends Today!”
* *Heading:* “Limited Time: Grab Yours Now”
* *Heading:* “Don’t Miss Out – Act Fast!”
* *Heading:* “Limited Supply—Order Before It’s Too Late”

*Reference:* Adding **time-related words** or deadlines creates urgency and can prevent procrastination.

## Value-Driven/Benefit CTAs

Value-driven CTAs emphasize the **user’s benefit or outcome**. They highlight savings, results, or exclusive gains to pique desire. Research shows that **specific, clear CTAs** with value can lift conversions (e.g. a tailored CTA increased clicks from 2% to 5%). Use strong verbs focusing on what the user *gains*:

* “Start Saving Today”
* “Boost Your Results”
* “Unlock Your Potential”
* “Get More Value”
* “Claim Your Discount”
* “Maximize Your Impact”
* *Heading:* “Experience the Best Value Today”
* *Heading:* “Get More from Your Investment”
* *Heading:* “Uncover Exclusive Benefits Now”
* *Heading:* “Maximize Your ROI with One Click”
* *Heading:* “Unlock Premium Features”

*Reference:* Effective CTAs often **sell the next step’s value** – focusing on outcomes like “boost conversions” or “save money” rather than generic phrases.

## Low-Friction/Low-Commitment CTAs

Low-friction CTAs minimize perceived effort or risk, encouraging people to click with little hesitation. Keep button text very short (generally 2–5 words) for maximum impact. Phrases like *“Get Started”* or *“Try It Now”* feel easy and approachable:

* “Get Started”
* “Try It Now”
* “Continue for Free”
* “No Credit Card Needed”
* “Explore Now”
* “Show Me How”
* *Heading:* “Get Started in Seconds”
* *Heading:* “Try It Today – No Commitment”
* *Heading:* “Sign Up Instantly with One Click”
* *Heading:* “Easy Setup – Join Now”
* *Heading:* “Easy Sign-Up – Get Started”

*Reference:* Short, clear CTAs reduce friction. Marketing tests suggest CTAs around 2–5 words convert best. Even changing “Book a Demo” to “Get Started” made PartnerStack’s conversion rate jump by 111%, likely because “Get Started” felt more welcoming and less salesy.

## Free/Trial Offer CTAs

“Free” and “trial” CTAs tap the **no-risk appeal**. Words like *“Free”* or *“Try”* dramatically increase interest – even top brands use *“free”* as a power word. For example, Evernote’s green “Try Evernote Free” button stands out because the word *“free”* “plays on people’s desire to get things at no cost”. These CTAs often promise samples, demos, or trial periods:

* “Start Free Trial”
* “Free Sample”
* “Try for Free”
* “Free Demo”
* “No-cost Trial”
* “Claim Free Audit”
* *Heading:* “Try It Free for 30 Days – No Credit Card Required”
* *Heading:* “Start Your Free Trial Now”
* *Heading:* “Get a Free Sample to Test the Benefits”
* *Heading:* “Experience the Solution at No Cost”
* *Heading:* “Try Our Service at Zero Cost”

*Reference:* “Free” is one of the most compelling words in CTAs. A bold CTA with *“free”* can dramatically boost sign-ups, as seen in multiple case studies.

## Curiosity-Driven CTAs

Curiosity CTAs tease new information or surprises, compelling clicks to **“see what’s next.”** They often pose a question or hint at hidden value. By creating an information gap, they lead into the *Interest* stage of AIDA. Examples:

* “Learn More”
* “Find Out How”
* “Discover More”
* “Reveal Insights”
* “Unlock Secrets”
* “What’s Inside?”
* *Heading:* “Discover the Secret That Gurus Won’t Tell You”
* *Heading:* “Find Out How You Could \[Benefit] Today”
* *Heading:* “Unlock Hidden Tips and Tricks – Click to Start”
* *Heading:* “Curious? Explore What’s Waiting”
* *Heading:* “Guess What’s Next”

*Reference:* These CTAs work by opening a knowledge gap, prompting the visitor’s curiosity. (While A/B data on curiosity hooks varies, using questions or hints of a secret is a well-known copy tactic.)

## Consultative/High-Touch CTAs

Consultative CTAs invite a personal touch: a conversation, demo, or consultation. They fit an approach where guidance and trust matter. Phrases like *“Talk to an Expert”* or *“Schedule a Call”* are welcoming. Examples:

* “Schedule a Call”
* “Book a Demo”
* “Talk to an Expert”
* “Free Consultation”
* “Request Callback”
* “Custom Solutions”
* *Heading:* “Schedule a Free Consultation with Our Team”
* *Heading:* “Have Questions? Talk to an Expert Now”
* *Heading:* “Book Your Personalized Demo Today”
* *Heading:* “Find the Right Solution – Let’s Discuss”
* *Heading:* “Let’s Tailor a Plan for You”

*Reference:* A/B testing shows that shifting language toward the customer’s needs can double conversions. For example, “Get Started” (customer-centric) outperformed “Book a Demo” (sales-centric) by 111%, demonstrating the power of consultative, helpful wording.

## Friendly/Human Tone CTAs

A friendly, conversational tone can make CTAs feel more personal and less corporate. Using “we” and “you,” or exclamation points, conveys warmth. These CTAs often sound like a peer or mentor speaking. Examples:

* “Let’s Do This”
* “Join Us Now”
* “Count Me In”
* “Let’s Chat”
* “I’m In”
* “Just for You”
* *Heading:* “Welcome! We’re Here to Help You Succeed.”
* *Heading:* “Join Our Community – We Grow Together”
* *Heading:* “Ready When You Are. Let’s Get Started!”
* *Heading:* “You’re Almost There – Let’s Finish This!”
* *Heading:* “You’ll Love This”
* *Heading:* “We’re Here for You Every Step of the Way”

*Reference:* Personalized, empathetic CTAs resonate better with visitors. HubSpot data shows **personalized CTAs** (which often use a more human tone) convert 202% better than generic CTAs. Speak to the user like a person (“We’re here to help”), and conversion rates can climb.

## Outcome-Focused/Transformational CTAs

Outcome CTAs emphasize a positive end-result or transformation the user will get. They answer “What’s in it for me?” by painting a picture of success. Examples:

* “Boost Your Sales”
* “Increase Productivity”
* “Solve Your Biggest Problem”
* “Achieve Results”
* “Transform Your Business”
* “Grow Your Audience”
* *Heading:* “Achieve the Results You Deserve”
* *Heading:* “Transform Your Workflow in Minutes”
* *Heading:* “Grow Your Audience Exponentially with Our Strategy”
* *Heading:* “Imagine Doubling Your Revenue – Get Started Today”
* *Heading:* “Achieve More, Starting Today”

*Reference:* Great CTAs **connect to the user’s goals**. They use verbs that promise change, e.g. “jumpstart your career” or “stop losing money”. By focusing on what happens *after* the click (results, improvements), these CTAs tap into the Desire stage of AIDA.

## Problem/Pain-Point (PAS) CTAs

These CTAs leverage the PAS (Problem–Agitate–Solve) formula by acknowledging a pain point and immediately offering relief or solution. They grab attention by relating to the user’s frustration:

* “Stop Losing Money”
* “No More Delays”
* “Fix It Today”
* “Eliminate \[Issue]”
* “End \[Pain] Now”
* “Solve \[Problem]”
* *Heading:* “Tired of \[Problem]? Get the Solution Today.”
* *Heading:* “Don’t Let \[Pain] Hold You Back – Act Now”
* *Heading:* “Sick of \[Negative]? We Can Help – Try Now”
* *Heading:* “Stop Wasting Time on \[Issue]—Start Solving It Today”
* *Heading:* “Struggling with \[Issue]? Let’s Solve It”

*Reference:* Addressing a **pain point directly** can be very effective. Copy before the CTA often highlights the problem, then the CTA is the solution. For example, marketing advice suggests writing CTAs like “Stop losing hard-earned money” after agitating the pain. This straightforward problem-solving tone drives clicks by promising a clear benefit.

**Sources:** These examples are grounded in CRO best practices and published conversion data. For instance, concise action verbs and clear value boosts clicks, and adding urgency (“Now”/“Today”) or personalization can lift conversions by over 150%. Use these CTAs as creative inspiration and always test variations on your own audience to find what truly performs best.
