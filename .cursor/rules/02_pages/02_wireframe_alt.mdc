# Rule: Creating Individual Page Wireframes

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating detailed, user-centered wireframes for individual pages/screens. The wireframe should translate specific page requirements into concrete visual structures using either ASCII text format or actual lo-fi HTML wireframes.

This wireframe will serve as a blueprint for that specific page's UI/UX design, development implementation, and stakeholder communication. It should be detailed enough for developers to understand functional requirements while being visually clear for stakeholders to provide feedback.

## Process

1. **Analyze Existing Documentation:** Review `master-product-brief.md` and `market-analysis.md` in the `/docs` folder to understand product vision, user personas, and feature requirements if those documents exist.
2. **Reference Supporting Documentation:** Use `wireframe_best_practices.md`, `wireframe_101.md`, and `example_wireframes.md` from the .cursor/rules/02_pages/supporting_docs folder for industry standards, methodologies, and proven patterns.
3. **Identify Page Context:** Understand where this page fits in the overall product flow and user journey.
4. **Conduct Focused Page Discovery:** Use the targeted question framework below to gather page-specific requirements.
5. **Validate Page Requirements:** Confirm user goals, content needs, and functionality before wireframe creation.
6. **Generate Page Wireframe:** Create either ASCII text wireframe or HTML lo-fi wireframe based on complexity and preference.
7. **Document Design Decisions:** Explain key layout and functionality decisions.
8. **Save Wireframe:** Save as individual wireframe file with descriptive naming.

## Wireframe Output Options

### Option A: ASCII Text Wireframe
For simpler pages or quick conceptual wireframes:
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  [LOGO]              [NAV MENU]    [USER PROFILE] |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  |
|  PAGE TITLE                           [BUTTON]   |
|  Subtitle or description text                    |
|                                                  |
|  +------------------+  +-------------------+     |
|  |     SECTION 1    |  |    SECTION 2      |     |
|  |  [Content here]  |  |  [Content here]   |     |
|  |  [Content here]  |  |  [Content here]   |     |
|  +------------------+  +-------------------+     |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  FOOTER CONTENT                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### Option B: HTML Lo-Fi Wireframe
For more complex pages or when interactive demonstration is helpful:
- Clean, minimal HTML structure
- Gray-scale color scheme
- Basic CSS for layout
- Placeholder content
- Interactive elements (buttons, forms)
- Responsive considerations
