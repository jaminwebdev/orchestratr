# Rule: Combined Wireframe & Content Generation (Evidence-Based)

## Purpose
Guide the AI to create a highly optimized, conversion-focused web page by:
- Conducting an interactive interview to gather all necessary context
- Referencing all supporting documentation in @/supporting_docs (wireframe_best_practices.md, wireframe_101.md, example_wireframes.md, copy_best_practices.md, copy_ctas.md, copy_headlines.md)
- Deciding on the optimal page structure/wireframe first, then writing evidence-based content for each section
- Producing a single markdown file with annotated wireframe and content, ready for design/dev handoff

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initiate Interactive Interview
Ask the user a comprehensive set of qualifying questions, drawing from both @02_wireframe.mdc and @03_write-content.mdc:
- Does a wireframe for this page already exist? If so, what is the file location?
- What is the primary goal of this page? (e.g., lead, sale, info)
- Who is your main user? (Describe as: [Name] is a [descriptor] who needs [need] because [why])
- Are there secondary user groups?
- What device(s) will users primarily use?
- What type of page is this? (homepage, product, etc.)
- How will users find this page? (ads, search, email, etc.)
- What industry are you in? Any special compliance or trust needs?
- What makes your offering unique?
- What are the top 2-3 user pain points or objections?
- What content/assets do you have or need? (images, testimonials, etc.)
- Are there brand, technical, SEO, or accessibility constraints?
- What is your brand personality and preferred tone?
- What are the main sections/components you expect on the page?
- Any integration, performance, or legal requirements?

*If user input is incomplete, prompt for missing info before proceeding.*

### 2. Synthesize User Input
- Summarize answers in a structured format
- Define the primary user persona and journey context
- Clarify the main conversion goal and any secondary objectives
- Note whether a wireframe file is provided and, if so, its location

### 3. Research & Best Practice Integration
- Reference all supporting docs in @/supporting_docs for:
  - Page-type and industry-specific wireframe/copy structures
  - Universal conversion, UX, and copywriting principles
  - Evidence-based recommendations for element order, copy length, CTA placement, etc.
- Explicitly cite research or best practice sources for each major decision
- If research is lacking, default to universal principles and note this

### 4. Decide on Page Structure (Wireframe)
- If a wireframe file is provided, read and use its structure section-by-section
- If not, create the optimal structure from scratch using best practices and user input
- Output the wireframe in markdown (ASCII or text-based as appropriate)
- For each section/element, include:
  - Purpose and rationale
  - Research/best practice citations
  - Accessibility/mobile notes
- Provide alternative layout options for critical sections if relevant

### 5. Write Content for Each Section
- For each section of the wireframe, generate:
  - Headline(s), subheadline(s), body/feature/benefit copy, social proof/trust copy, CTAs (with options)
- For each content block, include:
  - Purpose and rationale
  - Key copy and variations (as appropriate)
  - Research/best practice citations
  - SEO/accessibility notes
- Use evidence-based recommendations for copy length, tone, CTA language, etc.
- Provide 1-2 alternative headline and CTA options where appropriate

### 6. Annotate and Explain
- For each major section/element, briefly explain:
  - Why it is included and placed/written as shown
  - What research or best practice supports it
  - How it addresses the user's goals and context
- Highlight any areas where user input or research was especially influential

### 7. Output Testing & Next Steps
- Suggest A/B testing opportunities for high-impact elements (e.g., headline, CTA, offer, hero section)
- Recommend next steps for moving from wireframe/content draft to high-fidelity design and implementation

## Output Requirements
- Deliver a single markdown file with:
  - Section-by-section wireframe structure (with rationale and citations)
  - Content for each section (with rationale, citations, and alternatives)
  - User persona and context summary at the top
  - Clear, actionable layout for designers/developers
- Be concise, evidence-driven, and user-focused
- Always prioritize user needs, conversion, and accessibility

## Notes
- Always use the most recent and relevant research from all supporting docs
- If multiple best practices exist, briefly compare and recommend the best fit for the user's context
- Avoid visual design details unless research shows conversion impact
- Focus on structure, hierarchy, and conversion-driving content
