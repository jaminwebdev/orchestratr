# Rule: Evidence-Based Web Copy Generation via Interactive Interview

## Purpose
Guide the AI to generate high-conversion, user-centered web copy by:
- Conducting an interactive interview to gather all necessary context
- Integrating best practices and research from @copy_ctas.md, @copy_headlines.md, and @copy_best_practices.md
- Taking any existing wireframe into account, following its structure if provided
- Producing a markdown file with copy, rationale, research citations, and actionable structure

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initiate Interactive Interview
Ask the user a series of qualifying questions to gather:
- Does a wireframe for this page already exist? If so, what is the file location?
- Page objective(s) and success metrics
- Target user persona(s) and journey stage
- Page type and context (landing, product, about, etc.)
- Traffic source and user mindset
- Industry/niche and any regulatory or trust requirements
- Product/service details, benefits, and differentiators
- Brand personality, tone, and constraints
- Content assets available (testimonials, reviews, etc.)
- Any technical, SEO, or accessibility needs

**Example Questions:**
- Does a wireframe exist for this page? If yes, please provide the file location. If not, I will create the structure for you.
- What is the primary goal of this page? (e.g., lead, sale, info)
- Who is your main user? (Describe as: [Name] is a [descriptor] who needs [need] because [why])
- What type of page is this? (homepage, product, etc.)
- How will users find this page? (ads, search, email, etc.)
- What industry are you in? Any special compliance or trust needs?
- What makes your offering unique?
- What content/assets do you have or need?
- Are there brand, technical, or SEO constraints?

### 2. Synthesize User Input
- Summarize the answers in a structured format
- Define the primary user persona and journey context
- Clarify the main conversion goal and any secondary objectives
- Note whether a wireframe file is provided and, if so, its location

### 3. Research & Best Practice Integration
- Reference @copy_ctas.md, @copy_headlines.md, and @copy_best_practices.md for:
  - Page-type and industry-specific copy structures
  - Universal conversion and copywriting principles
  - Evidence-based headline, CTA, and body copy strategies
- Explicitly cite research or best practice sources for each major copy decision
- If research is lacking, default to universal copy principles and note this

### 4. Generate Copy Structure (Markdown)
- If a wireframe file is provided, read and follow its structure section-by-section, filling in content for each part as specified by the wireframe.
- If no wireframe exists, create a clear, section-by-section markdown copy structure as before:
  - Headline(s)
  - Subheadline(s)
  - Body/feature/benefit copy
  - Social proof/trust copy
  - CTAs (with options)
- For each section, include:
  - Purpose and rationale
  - Key copy and variations (as appropriate)
  - Research/best practice citations
  - SEO/accessibility notes
- Use evidence-based recommendations for copy length, tone, CTA language, etc.
- If possible, provide 1-2 alternative headline and CTA options

### 5. Annotate and Explain
- For each major section/element, briefly explain:
  - Why it is included and written as shown
  - What research or best practice supports it
  - How it addresses the user's goals and context
- Highlight any areas where user input or research was especially influential

### 6. Output Testing & Next Steps
- Suggest A/B testing opportunities for high-impact elements (e.g., headline, CTA, offer)
- Recommend next steps for moving from copy draft to implementation

## Output Requirements
- Deliver a markdown file with:
  - Section-by-section copy structure (following the wireframe if provided)
  - Rationale and research citations inline
  - User persona and context summary at the top
  - Clear, actionable copy for designers/developers
- Be concise, evidence-driven, and user-focused
- Always prioritize user needs, conversion, and accessibility

## Notes
- Always use the most recent and relevant research from the supporting docs
- If user input is incomplete, prompt for missing info before proceeding
- If multiple best practices exist, briefly compare and recommend the best fit for the user's context
- Avoid visual design details unless research shows conversion impact
- Focus on copy structure, hierarchy, and conversion-driving language

- **Before:** Current frustrating situation
- **After:** Desired ideal outcome
- **Bridge:** Your solution that gets them there

#### Features/Advantages/Benefits (FAB)

- **Features:** What it is/does
- **Advantages:** How it works
- **Benefits:** What it means for them

### Additional Techniques

- **Storytelling:** Use mini-narratives and customer success stories
- **Specificity:** Include concrete numbers, timeframes, and details
- **Reciprocity:** Offer valuable free content first
- **Authority:** Establish credibility through credentials, awards, media mentions
- **Risk Reversal:** Money-back guarantees, free trials, no-commitment offers

## Copy Structure Guidelines

### Headlines

- Promise a clear benefit or outcome
- Include power words and emotional triggers
- Use numbers, questions, or "how to" when appropriate
- Test variations of length (short punchy vs. descriptive)

### Subheadlines

- Expand on the main headline
- Address secondary benefits or objections
- Guide readers deeper into the page

### Body Copy

- Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Include bullet points for easy scanning
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- End sections with logical transitions

### Calls-to-Action (CTAs)

- Use action-oriented verbs (Get, Start, Discover, Claim)
- Create urgency when appropriate
- Be specific about what happens next
- Repeat throughout long pages

## Copy Types by Page Function

### Landing Pages

Focus on single conversion goal, minimal navigation, strong headlines, social proof, and prominent CTAs

### Homepage

Balance multiple audiences, establish credibility, highlight key benefits, guide to specific actions

### Product/Service Pages

Detail features and benefits, address objections, include specifications, showcase social proof

### About Pages

Build trust through story, establish authority, show personality, connect mission to audience benefits

### Pricing Pages

Anchor high value, highlight popular options, address common concerns, reduce perceived risk

## Target Audience

Assume the copy will be read by the defined user persona under various conditions (mobile vs. desktop, hurried vs. research mode, skeptical vs. ready to buy). Copy should be scannable, compelling, and conversion-focused regardless of reading context.

## Output Requirements

### Format Specifications

- **Primary Format:** Clean, formatted text with clear section headers
- **Structure:** Organized by page sections (Header, Hero, Features, Testimonials, CTA, etc.)

- **Technical Notes:** SEO considerations, character limits, A/B testing suggestions

## Final Instructions
