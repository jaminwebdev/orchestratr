# Rule: Evidence-Based Wireframe Generation via Interactive Interview

## Purpose
Guide the AI to generate high-conversion, user-centered wireframes by:
- Conducting an interactive interview to gather all necessary context
- Integrating best practices and research from /wireframe_best_practices.md, @wireframe_101.md, and @example_wireframes.md in the .cursor/rules/site/research_docs folder.
- Producing a markdown wireframe file with rationale, research citations, and actionable structure

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initiate Interactive Interview
Ask the user a series of qualifying questions to gather:
- Page objective(s) and success metrics
- Target user persona(s) and journey stage
- Device context (mobile/desktop/tablet)
- Page type (homepage, product, service, etc.)
- Industry/niche and any regulatory or trust requirements
- Content assets available (copy, images, testimonials, etc.)
- Brand personality and constraints
- Any technical, accessibility, or integration needs

**Example Questions:**
- What is the primary goal of this page? (e.g., lead, sale, info)
- Who is your main user? (Describe as: [Name] is a [descriptor] who needs [need] because [why])
- What device(s) will users primarily use?
- What type of page is this? (homepage, product, etc.)
- What industry are you in? Any special compliance or trust needs?
- What content/assets do you have or need?
- Are there brand, technical, or accessibility constraints?

### 2. Synthesize User Input
- Summarize the answers in a structured format
- Define the primary user persona and journey context
- Clarify the main conversion goal and any secondary objectives

### 3. Research & Best Practice Integration
- Reference @wireframe_best_practices.md, @wireframe_101.md, and @example_wireframes.md for:
  - Page-type and industry-specific wireframe structures
  - Universal conversion and UX principles
  - Evidence-based element placement, CTA, trust, and form strategies
- Explicitly cite research or best practice sources for each major design decision
- If research is lacking, default to universal UX principles and note this

### 4. Generate Wireframe Structure (Markdown)
- Output a clear, section-by-section markdown wireframe:
  - Header/nav
  - Hero/above-the-fold
  - Content/feature blocks
  - Social proof/trust
  - Forms/CTAs
  - Footer
- For each section, include:
  - Purpose and rationale
  - Key elements and layout (ASCII or text-based as appropriate)
  - Research/best practice citations
  - Accessibility/mobile notes
- Use evidence-based recommendations for element order, copy length, CTA placement, etc.
- If possible, provide 1-2 alternative layout options for critical sections

### 5. Annotate and Explain
- For each major section/element, briefly explain:
  - Why it is included and placed as shown
  - What research or best practice supports it
  - How it addresses the user’s goals and context
- Highlight any areas where user input or research was especially influential

### 6. Output Testing & Next Steps
- Suggest A/B testing opportunities for high-impact elements (e.g., CTA, form, hero copy)
- Recommend next steps for moving from wireframe to high-fidelity design

## Output Requirements
- Deliver a markdown file with:
  - Section-by-section wireframe structure
  - Rationale and research citations inline
  - User persona and context summary at the top
  - Clear, actionable layout for designers/developers
- Be concise, evidence-driven, and user-focused
- Always prioritize user needs, conversion, and accessibility

## Notes
- Always use the most recent and relevant research from the supporting docs
- If user input is incomplete, prompt for missing info before proceeding
- If multiple best practices exist, briefly compare and recommend the best fit for the user’s context
- Avoid visual design details (colors, fonts) unless research shows conversion impact
- Focus on structure, hierarchy, and conversion-driving elements
- **Mobile UX Patterns:** Current mobile-first design standards and touch interactions
- **Industry-Specific Studies:** Sector-specific user behavior research when available
- **Accessibility Standards:** Current WCAG guidelines and inclusive design practices
- **Loading Performance:** Impact of page structure on perceived and actual loading times

### Fallback for Limited Research

When specific research isn't available:

- Apply general UX principles and established patterns
- Reference broader industry standards
- Focus on fundamental user psychology and behavior
- Clearly note when recommendations are based on general principles vs. specific research

## Design Principles Integration

### Gestalt Principles

- **Proximity:** Group related elements together, separate unrelated ones
- **Similarity:** Use consistent styling for similar functions/content
- **Closure:** Create complete visual shapes and logical groupings
- **Continuity:** Guide eye movement through logical flow
- **Figure/Ground:** Establish clear foreground/background relationships

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Size:** Larger elements draw attention first
- **Color:** Strategic use of contrast and brand colors
- **Positioning:** Prime real estate for most important elements
- **Typography:** Varied font sizes and weights to create scanning patterns
- **White Space:** Strategic spacing to reduce cognitive load

### UX Fundamentals

- **Fitts's Law:** Larger, closer targets are easier to interact with
- **Miller's Rule:** Limit choices to 7±2 items when possible
- **Hick's Law:** Reduce decision time by limiting options
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal information progressively to avoid overwhelm
- **Recognition vs. Recall:** Make options visible rather than requiring memory

### Conversion Optimization Principles

- **Above the Fold Priority:** Critical elements visible without scrolling
- **F-Pattern Reading:** Structure content for natural eye movement
- **CTA Optimization:** Contrasting colors, action-oriented language, strategic placement
- **Friction Reduction:** Minimize steps and cognitive load
- **Social Proof Integration:** Strategic placement of testimonials and trust signals
