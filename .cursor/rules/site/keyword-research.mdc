# **Rule: Strategic Keyword Research**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in performing foundational keyword research for a specific topic, feature, or product described in a source document (like a PRD or brief). The objective is to identify, analyze, and categorize keyword opportunities.

The output is a structured keyword strategy report designed for content strategists, SEO managers, and marketers to use for planning future content, such as blog posts, landing pages, or documentation.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Review Input Document:** The process begins with the agent ingesting and analyzing a user-provided document or a detailed text description of the research topic. This is the primary source of context.
2.  **Consult Library Docs:** The agent **MUST** review `seo/keyword_research_process.md`, which defines the methodology for the research and analysis.
3.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the question framework below to clarify the scope, audience, and intent of the research with the user.
4.  **Generate & Analyze Keywords:** The agent will call a specialized tool, prioritizing the `dataforseo MCP` (or falling back to the `Perplexity MCP`), to generate a comprehensive list of keywords based on the source document and user input. It will then analyze these for estimated volume, difficulty, and user intent.
5.  **Generate Report:** The agent will structure the findings into a strategic report, organizing keywords into thematic clusters and providing actionable content recommendations.
6.  **Save Output:** Save the final report as `keyword-research_[topic]_[date].mdc` in the `/brainstorming/` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

  * "Please provide the document (e.g., product brief, PRD) or a detailed description of the topic you want me to research."
  * "Who is the primary audience for this topic? (e.g., technical experts, beginners, potential customers)."
  * "Are there any 'seed' keywords or core concepts you already know are important?"
  * "(Optional) Are there any known competitors whose content we should analyze for keyword ideas?"

### **4. Document Structure (Output)**

*(The generated report should follow this Markdown template.)*

```markdown

- [Question 1, e.g., "what are common cloud security threats"]
- [Question 2, e.g., "how much does a cloud security audit cost"]
- [Question 3, e.g., "aws vs azure security features"]

---

## 4. Content Strategy Recommendations
*Actionable ideas for content that can effectively target the keywords identified above.*

- **Pillar Page:** Create a comprehensive guide on "[Primary Keyword Theme]." This page will serve as a central hub and target high-volume informational keywords.
- **Blog Posts:**
    - Write a detailed post answering the question: "[Question 1]".
    - Create a comparison post: "[Question 3]".
- **Landing Page:** Develop a dedicated landing page for "[Commercial Keyword]" to capture high-intent traffic.

```

### **5. Quality Assurance Framework**

  - [ ] **Source Alignment:** Does the research clearly and accurately reflect the topic from the user-provided document?
  - [ ] **Data-Driven:** Are the keywords accompanied by metrics like volume and difficulty?
  - [ ] **Strategic Clustering:** Are keywords grouped into logical, thematic clusters rather than presented as one long list?
  - [ ] **Actionable Insights:** Does the report provide concrete content recommendations, not just raw data?

  - **DO NOT** just provide a data dump. The primary value is in the analysis and the strategic content recommendations.
  - **DO** clearly identify the user intent (Informational, Commercial, Transactional) for primary keyword groups.
  - **DO** use a specialized tool like the `dataforseo MCP` as the preferred source for quantitative keyword data.
