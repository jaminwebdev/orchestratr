# **Rule: New Page Generation**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in a rapid, end-to-end process for creating a single new webpage. The rule combines discovery, keyword research, content writing, wireframing, and task generation into a single, efficient workflow.

The output is a self-contained Markdown document with the final page copy, a wireframe, and an implementation task list, ready for a developer to build and integrate into the existing site.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Review Dependencies:** The agent **MUST** first review the core project documents to ensure consistency with the existing site:
      * `website_brief.md` (for overall brand voice and audience).
      * `design.md` (for the established visual design system and components).
      * `technical_plan` (for the current tech stack).
2.  **Consult Library Docs:** Review relevant documents from all subdirectories (`/seo/`, `/copywriting/`, `/design_ux/`) to ground the output in best practices.
3.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the comprehensive question framework below to gather all necessary information from the user in a single pass.
4.  **Keyword Research (Conditional):**
      * If the user provides target keywords, use them.
      * If not, perform a targeted keyword research task (using the Perplexity or dataforseo MCP) based on the page's stated purpose.
5.  **Generate Content & Wireframe:** Based on all inputs, generate the final page copy and a structural wireframe simultaneously.
6.  **Generate Task List:** Create a concise, actionable checklist for a developer to implement the new page.
7.  **Assemble and Save:** Combine the content, wireframe, and task list into a single Markdown file and save it as `[new-page-name].mdc` in the `/docs/new-pages/` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

#### 🎯 **Purpose & Goal**

  * What is the primary goal of this new page? (e.g., generate leads, inform users, announce a feature).
  * Who is the specific target audience for this page?
  * What is the single most important action a user should take after reading this page?
  * Where will this page live in the current site architecture? (e.g., linked from the main navigation, from a blog post, etc.).

#### 🔑 **SEO & Keywords**

  * Do you have a primary keyword you want to target? If not, I will research one based on the page's purpose.
  * What are some other related terms or questions a user might search for to find this page?

#### ✍️ **Content & Messaging**

  * What are the key messages, features, or pieces of information that **must** be on this page?
  * Please provide any raw notes, data points, or links that should be incorporated into the content.
  * What should the primary Call-to-Action (CTA) be? (e.g., "Sign Up Now," "Learn More," "Contact Us").

### **4. Document Structure (Output)**
