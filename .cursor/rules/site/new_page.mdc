- Do keyword research
- wireframe and write copy sequentially
  - should reference originally generated docs for consistency
  - should reference library_docs of course for making decisions and qualifying questions
- should reference design docs and library_docs screenshots for consistency
- spit out a new page doc
- need rule for generating tasks based on new page doc
- iterate on those tasks

- This might be too much for one rule. Maybe separate into another sequential workflow like 01_start
