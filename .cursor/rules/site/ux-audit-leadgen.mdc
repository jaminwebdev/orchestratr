# **Rule: Automated Lead Generation & UX Audit**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in creating a qualified lead generation report. The agent will identify local businesses based on user-provided criteria, programmatically audit their websites against a predefined list of common UX and copywriting mistakes, and filter for prospects with significant, high-impact issues.

The output is a structured report containing a list of qualified leads and, for each lead, a mini-audit with specific, actionable fixes. This report is designed to be used directly for targeted sales outreach, demonstrating immediate value to the prospect.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Consult Library Docs:** The agent **MUST** begin by ingesting and deeply understanding the `library_docs/copywriting/ux_and_copy_mistakes.md`. This document is the core rubric for the entire audit process. It should also consult `library_docs/copywriting/copy_best_practices.md` and files within the `library_docs/design_ux/` for context on how to propose fixes.
2.  **Conduct Discovery:** Ask the user for the business type, target locality, and the desired number of leads to generate.
3.  **Define Significance Model:** The agent will use a built-in heuristic to weigh the severity of the 20 mistakes.
      * **High Significance:** Issues that directly impact conversions and user trust (e.g., no clear Call-to-Action, confusing navigation, unclear value proposition, not mobile-friendly).
      * **Medium Significance:** Issues that create friction and frustration (e.g., hard-to-find contact info, poor readability, inconsistent branding).
      * **Low Significance:** Minor aesthetic or technical issues (e.g., inconsistent footer links, non-optimal image formats).
4.  **Initiate Search:** The agent will use a web search tool (e.g., Google Search) with a query like `"[business type] in [locality]"` to find a list of potential business websites.
5.  **Iterate and Audit:** The agent will loop through the search results:
      * a. For each website, it will access and analyze the content of the homepage, as well as key pages in the top navigation such as services or other links that appear relevant to the nature of the business (i.e. "films" and "photography" for a videography website, or "heating" and "cooling" for an HVAC website).
      * b. It will audit the page against the `ux_and_copy_mistakes.md` checklist, noting each violation and its significance level.
      * c. It will qualify a business as a lead if its website has a critical number of violations (e.g., **at least 3 significant issues, with one being of 'High' significance**).
      * d. If a business is qualified, the agent will generate proposed fixes and add it to the report. It will continue until the desired number of leads is reached.
6.  **Generate Final Report:** Once the target number of leads is found, the agent will compile all qualified prospects and their mini-audits into a single, structured document.
7.  **Save Report:** Save the final document as `lead-report_[type]_[locality].mdc` in a new `/leads/` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

  * "What type of business are we searching for? (e.g., 'Roofing Contractors', 'Family Law Firms', 'Boutique Coffee Shops')."
  * "What is the target locality? Please be as specific as possible (e.g., 'Overland Park, KS', 'Johnson County, KS', 'Kansas City Metro Area')."
  * "What is the target number of qualified leads you'd like me to find in this report?"

### **4. Document Structure (Output)**

*(The generated report should follow this Markdown template.)*

```markdown
# Lead Generation Report

- **Search Query:** [business type] in [locality]
- **Report Date:** July 3, 2024
- **Qualified Leads Found:** [Number]

---

## 1. Lead: [Business Name]
- **URL:** [website.com]
- **Status:** Qualified Prospect

### Identified Issues (4 Violations):
| Significance | Issue | Details / Location |
|---|---|---|
| **High** | #1: No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA) | The homepage lacks a primary button in the main view. Users don't know what to do next. |
| **High** | #3: Unclear Value Proposition | The headline is "Welcome to [Business Name]". It doesn't explain what the business does or for whom. |
| **Medium** | #9: Contact Info Hard to Find | Phone number is only present in the footer, requiring a full scroll. |
| **Low** | #18: Inconsistent Link Styling | Some links are blue and underlined, others are just bolded black text. |

### Proposed Fixes & Outreach Angle:
* **UX Fixes:**
    1.  **Add a Primary CTA:** Introduce a prominent button in the hero section with clear, action-oriented text like "Get a Free Estimate Now."
    2.  **Surface Contact Info:** Add the primary phone number to the top right corner of the main navigation bar.
* **Copywriting Fixes:**
    1.  **Rewrite Headline:** Change the headline to be benefit-driven, such as: "The Most Trusted Roofers in Overland Park - Guaranteed for 10 Years."
* **Outreach Angle:** "I noticed your website could be generating more leads with a few quick adjustments to the homepage. For example, by clarifying your headline and adding a 'Get a Free Estimate' button, you could see a significant increase in customer inquiries."

### **5. Quality Assurance Framework**

  * [ ] **Relevance:** Are the businesses found relevant to the user's search query?
  * [ ] **Accurate Audit:** Do the identified issues accurately reflect problems on the live website and map back to the `ux_and_copy_mistakes.md` document?
  * [ ] **Actionable Fixes:** Are the proposed solutions specific, concrete, and easy to understand?
  * [ ] **Filtering Logic:** Did the agent correctly apply the "3-5 significant mistakes" filter to qualify leads?
