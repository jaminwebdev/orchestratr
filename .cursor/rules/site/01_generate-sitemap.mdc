# Rule: Evidence-Based Sitemap Generation via Interactive Interview

## Purpose
Guide the AI to generate a comprehensive, research-backed website sitemap by:
- Conducting an interactive interview to gather all necessary context
- Integrating best practices and research from @sitemaps_best_practices.md in the .cursor/rules/site/research_docs folder
- Producing a clear, annotated sitemap (in markdown or diagram format) with rationale, research citations, and actionable structure

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initiate Interactive Interview
Ask the user qualifying questions to gather:
- Website/business objectives and primary success metrics
- Target audience(s) and key user journeys
- Website type (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, content, corporate, etc.)
- Industry/niche and any regulatory or accessibility requirements
- Content types and major sections (products, blog, resources, etc.)
- Geographic/language requirements (internationalization, localization)
- Any known competitors or reference sites
- Technical or platform constraints (CMS, headless, etc.)
- Any special SEO, performance, or mobile-first needs

**Example Questions:**
- What is the main goal of your website? (e.g., sales, leads, education)
- Who are your primary users? (Describe their needs and behaviors)
- What type of site is this? (e-commerce, SaaS, blog, etc.)
- What are the must-have sections or content types?
- Are there any industry-specific or legal requirements?
- Do you need support for multiple languages or regions?
- Are there reference sites you admire or want to avoid?
- Any technical, SEO, or accessibility constraints?

### 2. Synthesize User Input
- Summarize answers in a structured format
- Define primary user journeys and business goals
- Clarify any special requirements or constraints

### 3. Research & Best Practice Integration
- Reference @sitemaps_best_practices.md for:
  - Information architecture and sitemap patterns by site type/industry
  - SEO, accessibility, and mobile-first considerations
  - Evidence-based recommendations for hierarchy, depth, and navigation
- Explicitly cite research or best practice sources for major sitemap decisions
- If research is lacking, default to universal IA/UX principles and note this

### 4. Generate Sitemap Structure (Markdown/Diagram)
- Output a clear, hierarchical sitemap in markdown (bulleted list or tree diagram)
- For each major section, include:
  - Purpose and rationale
  - Key pages and relationships
  - Research/best practice citations
  - Notes on SEO, accessibility, or mobile considerations
- Suggest alternative structures if multiple best practices exist

### 5. Annotate and Explain
- For each major section/branch, briefly explain:
  - Why it is included and placed as shown
  - What research or best practice supports it
  - How it addresses user and business goals

### 6. Output Testing & Next Steps
- Suggest user testing or tree testing opportunities for navigation
- Recommend next steps for moving from sitemap to wireframe or prototype

## Output Requirements
- Deliver a markdown file with:
  - Hierarchical sitemap structure
  - Rationale and research citations inline
  - User/business context summary at the top
  - Clear, actionable structure for designers/developers
- Be concise, evidence-driven, and user-focused
- Always prioritize user needs, SEO, and accessibility

## Notes
- Always use the most recent and relevant research from @sitemaps_best_practices.md
- If user input is incomplete, prompt for missing info before proceeding
- If multiple best practices exist, compare and recommend the best fit
- Focus on structure, hierarchy, and discoverabilityâ€”not visual design
