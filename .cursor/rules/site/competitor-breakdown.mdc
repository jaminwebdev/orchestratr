# **Rule: Competitive Deep Dive & Strategic Analysis (V2)**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in performing a deep, multi-faceted analysis of a single competitor's website. This rule is flexible: it will always deconstruct the competitor's public strategy. **If our own business documents are available, it will perform a detailed strategic comparison; otherwise, it will provide an objective analysis** based on general best practices.

The output is a comprehensive strategic report identifying the competitor's strengths and weaknesses, and, when possible, a direct comparison to our strategy to reveal actionable opportunities and threats.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Check for Internal Context (Optional):** The agent begins by checking for the existence of `00_create_business_model.mdc` or `01_create_brief_audience.mdc` in the `/docs/` directory. This step is optional and determines the depth of the final analysis.
2.  **Consult Library Docs:** The agent will load the specified list of supporting documents (`wireframe_best_practices`, `common_ux_and_copy_mistakes`, etc.) to use as a universal rubric for the UX and copy audit.
3.  **Conduct Discovery:** Ask the user to provide the URL of the competitor to be analyzed.
4.  **Execute Phase 1: Competitor Data Extraction**
      * The agent will perform a technical analysis of the competitor's URL to infer or identify:
          * Top target keywords and general SEO footprint.
          * A breakdown of their sitemap and information architecture.
          * Their likely business model (e.g., SaaS, e-commerce, advertising, lead-gen).
          * The general layout and content structure of their top navigation/priority pages.
5.  **Execute Phase 2: Analysis & Synthesis (Conditional)**
      * **If internal documents were found:** The agent will perform a deep *comparative* analysis, comparing the competitor's strategy directly against our own business model, value proposition, and audience.
      * **If internal documents were NOT found:** The agent will perform an *objective* audit, evaluating the competitor's strengths and weaknesses solely against the best practices defined in the library documents.
6.  **Generate Report:** Assemble the complete analysis into a structured Markdown report, including the optional comparative section if applicable.
7.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `competitor-analysis_[competitor-name].mdc` in the `/analysis/` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

  * "Please provide the full URL of the competitor's website you want me to analyze."
  * "(Optional) What is the primary question you are trying to answer about this competitor? (e.g., 'How do they position their pricing?', 'What is their content strategy?', 'Is their user onboarding effective?')."

### **4. Document Structure (Output)**

*(The generated report will follow this Markdown template. Section 4 is conditional.)*

```markdown
# Competitor Analysis: [Competitor Name]
- **URL:** [Competitor URL]
- **Analysis Date:** [Date of Analysis]
- **Analysis Type:** [Objective Audit | Comparative Analysis]

---
## 1. Executive Summary
*A high-level overview of the key findings.*
- **Competitor's Core Strategy:** [e.g., They target SMBs with a low-cost, self-service SaaS model, focusing on ease of use.]
- **Primary Strength:** [e.g., Excellent SEO ranking for informational "how-to" keywords.]
- **Primary Weakness:** [e.g., Confusing user interface for advanced features.]
- **Key Takeaway:** [A summary of the most important lesson or opportunity learned from this analysis.]

---
## 2. Competitor Deconstruction
*An objective breakdown of the competitor's online presence.*

### 2.1. Inferred Business Model
- **Revenue Streams:** [e.g., Tiered Subscription (SaaS)]
- **Target Customer Segments:** [e.g., Freelancers, Small Businesses]
- **Value Proposition:** [e.g., "The simplest way to manage your projects."]

### 2.2. Target Keywords & SEO Footprint
- **Top Informational Keywords:** [List of keywords]
- **Top Commercial Keywords:** [List of keywords]

### 2.3. Sitemap & Information Architecture
- **Main Navigation:** [e.g., Features, Pricing, Blog, About Us]
- **Overall Structure:** [e.g., A feature-centric architecture.]

---
## 3. Objective Audit (vs. Best Practices)
*An audit of the competitor's site against established best practices from the library.*

### 3.1 UX & Copywriting Strengths
- [e.g., **(Copy)** Their headline is exceptionally clear and benefit-oriented, per `copy_best_practices_2`.]
- [e.g., **(UX)** The sign-up process is very low-friction, a key principle from `ux_and_design_101`.]

### 3.2 UX & Copywriting Weaknesses
- [e.g., **(Copy)** Their feature descriptions are full of jargon, a common mistake noted in `common_ux_and_copy_mistakes`.]
- [e.g., **(UX)** Their navigation menu has too many items, violating simplicity principles from `wireframe_best_practices`.]

---
***Note:** The following 'Strategic Comparison' section is only included because internal business documents were available for a direct comparison.*

## 4. (Optional) Strategic Comparison (vs. Our Business)
### 4.1. Business Model & Audience Comparison
- **Our Model vs. Theirs:** [e.g., While they focus on a low-touch, high-volume model, our business model targets high-touch enterprise clients.]
- **Audience Overlap:** [e.g., Minimal overlap in target customers.]

### 4.2. Targeted Pain Points
- [e.g., Their copy consistently targets the pain of disorganization for small teams, while our strategy focuses on compliance and security for large corporations.]

---
## 5. Identified Blind Spots & Strategic Opportunities
*Actionable insights based on the analysis. The nature of these opportunities depends on whether a direct comparison was possible.*
- **Market Gap:** [e.g., They have no content or features addressing the needs of regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance).]
- **Content Opportunity:** [e.g., Create content that directly addresses the weaknesses found in their UX and copy, positioning our solution as the more user-friendly alternative.]
```

### **5. Quality Assurance Framework**

  * [ ] **Conditional Logic:** Was the analysis type correctly identified and was Section 4 only included if internal documents were provided?
  * [ ] **Comprehensive Deconstruction:** Did the agent analyze all requested components (keywords, sitemap, business model)?
  * [ ] **Actionable Output:** Are the identified "Blind Spots & Opportunities" specific and actionable?
  * [ ] **Library Integration:** Does the Objective Audit (Section 3) explicitly reference principles from the specified `/library_docs/`?

### **6. Supporting Library Documents**

  * `wireframe_best_practices.md`
  * `wireframe_best_practices_2.md`
  * `common_ux_and_copy_mistakes.md`
  * `ux_and_design_101.md`
  * `ux_and_design_102.md`
  * `copy_best_practices_2.md`

### **7. Integration with Other Documentation**

  * **Input (Optional):** This rule can use `00_create_business_model.mdc` and/or `01_create_brief_audience.mdc` to provide a richer, comparative analysis. If they are not present, it functions independently.
  * **Output:** The insights from this report can inform updates to our own documents, spark ideas for the `create-new-page` rule, or justify a new `programmatic-seo` initiative.

### **8. Best Practices**

1.  **Go Beyond the Surface:** Infer the *strategy* behind their decisions, not just what's on the page.
2.  **Focus on "So What?":** For every piece of data, the analysis should answer "So what does this mean?".
3.  **Identify Actionable Levers:** The most valuable output is a list of things we can *do* in response.
4.  **Clearly State the Context:** The report should immediately clarify whether it's a direct comparison or an objective audit.

### **9. Output Requirements**

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.mdc`)
  - **Location:** `/analysis/`
  - **Filename:** `competitor-analysis_[competitor-name].mdc`

### **10. Final Instructions**

  - **DO** begin by checking for internal documents to determine the type of analysis to perform.
  - **DO** structure the final report to clearly separate the objective deconstruction from the subjective or comparative analysis.
  - **DO** explicitly reference the principles from the specified library documents when performing the audit.
  - **DO** ensure the final "Opportunities" section is filled with actionable, strategic ideas.

### **11. Key Success Factors**

  - **Flexibility:** The rule operates effectively both with and without internal context, making it a versatile tool.
  - **Strategic Insight:** The report delivers genuine "aha\!" moments, not just a data dump.
  - **Actionability:** The findings directly translate into potential projects, marketing campaigns, or product roadmap adjustments.
  - **360-Degree View:** The rule successfully combines SEO, business strategy, UX, and copywriting analysis into a single, cohesive report.
