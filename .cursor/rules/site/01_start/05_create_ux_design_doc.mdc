# Rule: Creating Comprehensive UX & Design Considerations Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, strategic UX & Design Considerations document in Markdown format that builds upon all previously completed website documentation. The UX & Design document should provide comprehensive visual design systems, interaction principles, emotional tone, and brand expression frameworks that directly address user needs identified in earlier research phases.

This document will serve as the definitive creative and usability brief for UI/UX designers, frontend developers, and content creators, ensuring consistent, user-centered design implementation that supports conversion goals and user journey optimization identified in previous strategic documents.

## Process

1. **Analyze Sequential Documentation:** Thoroughly review all preceding documents in the `/docs` folder in order:
   - `website-brief.md` - Business objectives, brand positioning, target market, and success metrics
   - `audience-research.md` - User personas, behavioral insights, digital preferences, and pain points
   - `sitemaps-document.md` - Site structure, navigation priorities, and user flow pathways
   - `wireframes-document.md` - Layout frameworks, content hierarchy, and interaction patterns

2. **Cross-Reference Strategic Alignment:** Identify design implications from previous findings:
   - Brand personality indicators from business positioning and audience preferences
   - Visual complexity levels based on user technical sophistication and preferences
   - Navigation patterns that support identified user journeys and conversion goals
   - Content presentation needs derived from audience information consumption preferences

3. **Conduct Strategic Design Discovery:** Using the enhanced question framework to fill gaps not covered in previous documentation

4. **Validate Design Strategy:** Ensure design recommendations directly support:
   - Business objectives from the website brief
   - User needs and preferences from audience research
   - Site structure and navigation from sitemaps
   - Layout and interaction patterns from wireframes

5. **Generate Integrated Design Framework:** Create comprehensive design guidelines that reference and build upon previous strategic decisions

6. **Quality Assurance Review:** Verify design recommendations align with and enhance the complete website strategy

7. **Save Document:** Save as `ux-design-considerations.md` in the `/docs` directory

## Enhanced Design Discovery Questions

- **Conversion Path Emphasis:** How should the design visually prioritize the conversion goals and success metrics outlined in the website brief?
- **Content Categorization:** How should visual design help users navigate the content categories and information architecture established in the sitemap?

### üìê Wireframe Enhancement & Interaction Design
- **Layout System Refinement:** How should the visual design enhance and refine the layout frameworks established in wireframes?
- **Interactive Element Design:** What visual treatment should interactive elements receive based on the user interaction preferences from audience research?
- **Content Hierarchy Visualization:** How should typography, color, and spacing reinforce the content hierarchy established in wireframes?
- **Mobile vs Desktop Considerations:** How should the design adapt the wireframe concepts for different devices based on audience usage patterns?

### üîß Technical Implementation & Performance
- **Performance vs Visual Richness:** Given the technical specifications and user device preferences, how should visual complexity be balanced with performance?
- **Browser and Device Compatibility:** What design constraints are imposed by the technical requirements and audience device usage patterns?
- **Content Management Considerations:** How should the design system accommodate the content strategy and ongoing content management needs?
