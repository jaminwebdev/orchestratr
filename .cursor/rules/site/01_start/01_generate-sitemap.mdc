#### Target Audience & User Journey Analysis
- Who is your primary user persona? (Format: "[Name] is a [descriptor] who wants to [goal] because [motivation]")
- Are there secondary user personas? How do their needs differ?
- What are the top 3-5 user journeys you need to support? (awareness → conversion, support → resolution, etc.)
- How do users typically discover your site? (search, ads, social, referrals, direct)

#### Technical & Platform Considerations
- What CMS or platform will you be using? (WordPress, Shopify, custom, headless, etc.)
- Are there any technical constraints or limitations to consider?
- Do you need special functionality? (user accounts, e-commerce, forums, membership areas, etc.)
- Are there third-party integrations that affect structure? (CRM, inventory, payment systems, etc.)

#### Accessibility & Compliance Needs
- What accessibility standards must you meet? (WCAG 2.1 AA, Section 508, etc.)
