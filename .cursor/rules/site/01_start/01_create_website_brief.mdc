# Rule: Generating a Comprehensive Website Brief

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, actionable Website Brief in Markdown format that serves as the foundational document for website planning and development. The brief should be comprehensive enough for stakeholders at all levels - from designers to developers to business owners - to understand the website's purpose, requirements, and implementation approach.

The generated website brief will serve as the single source of truth and be referenced throughout the entire development lifecycle, including audience research, sitemaps, wireframes, UX design, content strategy, and task planning.
