# **Rule: Competitor & Keyword Research Generation**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in creating a `02_create_competitor_keyword_research.md` document. This document identifies key competitors, analyzes their online strategies, and establishes a foundational keyword strategy for SEO and content creation.

This rule is designed with **dual flexibility**. It handles two main phases, each with a conditional path:

1.  **Competitor Analysis:** Uses a provided document or generates a new one.
2.  **Keyword Research:** Uses a provided document or generates a new one.

The final document is for content strategists, SEO specialists, and site architects.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Review Dependencies:** The agent **MUST** first ingest and analyze the approved `/docs/01_create_brief_audience.md` document.
2.  **Initiate Discovery - Phase 1 (Competitor Analysis):** Ask the user if they have a pre-existing competitor analysis document.
3.  **Conditional Execution (Competitor Analysis):**
      * **If YES, a document is provided:** Parse the document to use as the analysis basis.
      * **If NO document is provided:** Initiate a sub-process to generate the analysis using the Perplexity MCP, guided by the Product Brief and user answers, and present it for validation.
4.  **Initiate Discovery - Phase 2 (Keyword Research):** With the competitor analysis established, ask the user if they have a pre-existing, prioritized keyword research document.
5.  **Conditional Execution (Keyword Research):**
      * **If YES, a document is provided:** Parse the document. Perform an alignment check against the Product Brief and competitor analysis.
      * **If NO document is provided:** Initiate a sub-process:
          * a. Use the "Keyword Discovery" questions below to gather seed terms and context from the user.
          * b. **Action:** Attempt to call the specialized `dataforseo MCP`. If unavailable, fall back to the `Perplexity MCP`.
          * c. The prompt should be: *"Given the attached Product Brief and Competitor Analysis, generate a list of relevant keywords. Prioritize them and group them into thematic clusters based on user intent (informational, commercial, transactional)."*
          * d. Present the generated keyword list to the user for validation and refinement.
6.  **Consult Library Docs:** Review `seo/keyword_research_process.md`.
7.  **Generate Document:** Create the `Competitor & Keyword Research` document using the specified structure.
8.  **Quality Assurance:** Perform a validation check using the QA framework.
9.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `02_create_competitor_keyword_research.md` in the `/docs` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

#### **Phase 1: üïµÔ∏è Competitor Analysis**

  * **Initial Check:** "Do you have an existing competitor analysis document to provide? If not, I can perform a basic analysis for you."
  * **(If no document) Follow-up Questions:**
      * "The Product Brief mentioned [Competitor X, Y]. Are there others we should analyze?"
      * "Are we focused on local, national, or international competitors?"

#### **Phase 2: üîë Keyword Research**

  * **Initial Check:** "Do you have an existing keyword research document with prioritized keywords? If not, I can generate a foundational list."
  * **(If no document) Follow-up Questions:**
      * "What are 5-10 'seed' terms or core topics you believe your audience searches for?"
      * "What key questions should our website be able to answer for a user?"
      * "Are there any industry-specific phrases or negative keywords we should be aware of?"

### **5. Quality Assurance Framework**

  - [ ] **Dependency Check:** Was the `/docs/01_create_brief_audience.md` document successfully analyzed?
  - [ ] **Process Compliance:** Was the correct conditional path (user doc vs. generation) followed for both competitor and keyword analysis?
  - [ ] **Keyword Relevance:** Do the keywords align with the goals and audience from the Product Brief?
  - [ ] **Intent Clarity:** Is each keyword or cluster associated with a user intent?
  - [ ] **Actionability:** Is the output clear enough to inform a sitemap and content calendar?

### **6. Supporting Library Documents**

  - `library_docs/seo/keyword_research_process.md`: **(Primary)** Must be used as the methodological guide, especially if the AI is generating the keyword list.
  - `library_docs/seo/on-page-seo.md`: To provide context on how these keywords will eventually be implemented.

### **7. Integration with Other Documentation**

  - **Input:** Critically dependent on `01_create_brief_audience.md`.
  - **Output:** A primary input for `03_create_architecture_content.md`.

### **8. Best Practices**

1.  **Focus on Intent:** Prioritize the *intent* behind a keyword over raw search volume.
2.  **Validate & Refine:** AI-generated lists are a starting point. Always have the user validate the keywords for business relevance.
3.  **Find the Gaps:** The goal of competitor analysis is to find actionable gaps.
4.  **Cluster, Don't Just List:** Grouping keywords into thematic clusters is essential for building topic authority.

### **9. Output Requirements**

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
  - **Location:** `/docs/`
  - **Filename:** `02_create_competitor_keyword_research.md`

### **10. Final Instructions**

  - **DO NOT** skip the dependency check of the `/docs/01_create_brief_audience.md` file.
  - **DO** explicitly ask the user for existing documents for **both** the competitor analysis and keyword research phases before attempting to generate them.
  - **DO** prioritize using the specialized `dataforseo MCP` for keyword generation, falling back to `Perplexity MCP` only if necessary.
  - **DO** present any AI-generated analysis or lists to the user for validation before finalizing the document.

### **11. Key Success Factors**
