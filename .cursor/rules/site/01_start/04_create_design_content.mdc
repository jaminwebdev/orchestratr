# **Rule: Design & Content Creation**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in creating the `design.md` document. This comprehensive document will contain the final website copy, visual wireframes for key pages, and the core elements of the visual design system. Its purpose is to create a complete and harmonious specification for how the website will look, feel, and communicate.

This document is primarily for front-end developers who will build the interface and for key stakeholders who need to approve the final design and messaging before development begins.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Review Dependencies:** The agent **MUST** first ingest and analyze `/docs/architecture_content.md`. The sitemap and, most importantly, the **Page Content Blueprints** are the direct instruction set for this rule. It should also reference `/docs/website_brief.md` for brand identity and audience context.
2.  **Consult Library Docs:** Review all relevant documents in the `/library_docs/design_ux/` and `/library_docs/copywriting/` directories to load best practices for UI design, wireframing, and copywriting.
3.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the question framework below to gather user preferences on visual aesthetics, design direction, and any final content details.
4.  **Execute Phase 1: Content First:** Based on the Page Content Blueprints from `/docs/architecture_content.md` and user input, generate the **final, polished copy** for each key page (Headlines, body text, CTAs, etc.). Present this copy to the user for review and approval *before* creating wireframes.
5.  **Execute Phase 2: Wireframing:** Once the copy for a page is approved, create a wireframe for that page. The wireframe must be structured according to the modules in the blueprint and **must incorporate the final copy** from the previous phase, not placeholder text.
6.  **Execute Phase 3: Design System Definition:** Concurrently, define the core visual design system (colors, typography) based on user input.
7.  **Generate Document:** Assemble the approved copy, wireframes, and design system elements into the `Design & Content Creation` document using the specified structure.
8.  **Quality Assurance:** Perform a validation check using the QA framework.
9.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `design.md` in the `/docs` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

#### 🎨 **Visual & Design System**

  * "Please provide your primary and secondary brand colors. Hex codes are preferred (e.g., `#1A2B3C`)."
  * "Describe the desired aesthetic or feeling of the website in a few words (e.g., 'minimal and modern,' 'warm and trustworthy,' 'bold and energetic')."
  * "Do you have any preferences for typography? For example, 'a clean sans-serif font for readability.' If you're unsure, I can recommend pairings based on the aesthetic."
  * "Are there any websites you admire for their visual design that we can use as inspiration?"

#### ✍️ **Content & Copy Refinement**

  * "Looking at the Homepage blueprint, is there a specific, powerful testimonial we should feature in the 'Social Proof' section?"
  * "For the Service/Product pages, are there any specific data points, statistics, or client results we can use to make the benefits more compelling?"

### **4. Document Structure**

## 4. Next Steps
- The Design System and Wireframes provide the visual and structural specification for development.
- The Final Copy is ready to be implemented in the CMS.
- **Action Item:** Proceed to Step 5: Technical Implementation Planning.
```

### **5. Quality Assurance Framework**

  - [ ] **Content-First Principle:** Do the wireframes correctly incorporate the *final, approved copy*?
  - [ ] **Blueprint Adherence:** Does each wireframe include all the required modules specified in the `/docs/architecture_content.md` page blueprints?
  - [ ] **Visual Consistency:** Is the defined color palette and typography used consistently across all wireframes?
  - [ ] **Brand Alignment:** Does the overall design direction align with the brand identity and audience described in `websit_brief`?
  - [ ] **Copy Quality:** Is the final copy persuasive, error-free, and does it reflect the brand's tone of voice?
  - [ ] **Accessibility Check:** Is there sufficient color contrast? Are fonts readable? (Consult `ux_and_design_101.md`).

### **7. Integration with Other Documentation**

  - **Input:** Critically dependent on `/docs/architecture_content.md` for the blueprints and structure. Relies on `/docs/website_brief.md` for brand and audience context.
  - **Output:** This document is the primary visual and content specification for developers and a key input for `05_create_technical_plan.mdc` and `06_create_mvp_tasks.mdc`.

### **8. Best Practices**

1.  **Content-First Wireframing:** Ensure design serves the message by finalizing copy before or during the layout process.
2.  **Design for Harmony:** The copy, layout, and visual elements should all work together to achieve the page's goal.
3.  **Mobile-First Thinking:** While wireframes may be for desktop, consider how the elements will reflow and remain effective on smaller screens.
4.  **Clarity and Simplicity:** Avoid clutter. Every element on the page should have a clear purpose.

### **9. Output Requirements**

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
  - **Location:** `/docs/`
  - **Filename:** `design.md`

### **10. Final Instructions**

  - **DO NOT** use "lorem ipsum" or placeholder text. The agent must generate and use the approved final copy for all wireframes.
  - **DO** present the final copy to the user for approval *before* proceeding to the wireframing stage.
  - **DO** ensure the wireframes are a direct visual representation of the content blueprints from the previous step.
  - **DO** reference the library documents for best practices on typography, layout, and copywriting.

### **11. Key Success Factors**

  - **Harmony:** The final document demonstrates a seamless integration of copy, layout, and visual style.
  - **Clarity:** The wireframes and copy provide an unambiguous plan for developers.
  - **Efficiency:** The "content-first" approach prevents costly redesigns and content rewrites during the development phase.
  - **Strategic Execution:** The final design and content effectively execute the strategy laid out in the first three documents.
