# Rule: Writing High-Converting Website Content

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating comprehensive, conversion-optimized website content that seamlessly integrates with wireframe specifications and fulfills the strategic content framework established in previous documentation. The content must be highly targeted, persuasive, and perfectly aligned with user needs, business objectives, and design constraints while implementing proven copywriting techniques for maximum conversion impact.

This rule produces actual website copy‚Äîheadlines, body text, CTAs, microcopy, and all written content elements‚Äîthat can be directly implemented into the website, ensuring every word serves the strategic goals identified throughout the planning process.

## Process

1. **Analyze All Strategic Foundation Documents:** Thoroughly review all preceding documents in the `/docs` folder:
   - `website-brief.md` - Business objectives, value propositions, target outcomes, and success metrics
   - `audience-research.md` - User personas, language preferences, pain points, and decision-making factors
   - `sitemaps-document.md` - Site structure, page hierarchy, and content organization requirements
   - `wireframes-document.md` - Layout specifications, content blocks, character limits, and UI copy placement
   - `ux-design-considerations.md` - Brand personality, visual-content integration, and user experience priorities
   - `content-strategy.md` - Voice guidelines, messaging framework, and content creation standards

2. **Integrate Copywriting Best Practices:** Reference and apply insights from `/research_docs/`:
   - `copy_101.md` - Fundamental copywriting principles and persuasion techniques
   - `copy_best_practices.md` - Advanced conversion optimization and messaging strategies
   - `copy_headlines.md` - Headline formulas, attention-grabbing techniques, and engagement optimization

3. **Cross-Reference Content Implementation Requirements:** Extract specific content needs from previous findings:
   - Exact content blocks and character limits from wireframes
   - Brand voice and tone specifications from content strategy
   - User language preferences and communication style from audience research
   - Conversion goals and persuasion priorities from business objectives
   - Design-content integration requirements from UX considerations

4. **Conduct Content-Specific Discovery:** Ask targeted questions to clarify implementation details not covered in previous documentation

5. **Generate Wireframe-Matched Content:** Create actual copy that fits perfectly within wireframe specifications while maximizing conversion potential

6. **Optimize for Multi-Device Experience:** Ensure content works effectively across all device breakpoints specified in wireframes

7. **Quality Assurance Review:** Validate content against strategic framework, conversion best practices, and implementation requirements

8. **Save Document:** Save as `website-content.md` in the `/docs` directory
