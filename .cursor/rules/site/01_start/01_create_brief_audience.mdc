# **Rule: Product Brief & Audience Research Generation**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed and actionable **Product Brief & Audience Research** document in Markdown format. This document serves as the foundational "source of truth" for the entire project, establishing a shared understanding of the project's vision, goals, scope, and target users.

It is created for all project stakeholders, from leadership and marketing teams to designers and developers. Every subsequent document in this workflow will reference this brief to ensure strategic alignment.

### **2. Process**

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a high-level description or concept for the new website or product.
2.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Ask the user if they have existing business plan documentation. If so, ingest said documentation and reference the information to answer any questions in the discovery phase. If any questions are left unanswered, ask the user for that information. If no business plan exists, proceed to use the comprehensive question framework below to methodically gather all necessary information from the user.
3.  **Consult Library Docs:** Review the specified supporting documents from the `/library_docs` directory to incorporate foundational best practices.
4.  **Validate Understanding:** Before generation, provide a summary of the core vision, audience, and goals to the user for confirmation.
5.  **Generate Document:** Create the `Product Brief & Audience Research` document using the specified structure.
6.  **Quality Assurance:** Perform a validation check using the QA framework to ensure the document is complete, clear, and actionable.
7.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `website_brief.md` in the `/docs` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

*(The agent should use these questions to gather all required information from the user.)*

#### 🎯 **Product Vision & Strategy**

  * **Core Purpose:** What is the fundamental problem this website solves or the primary goal it aims to achieve?
  * **Value Proposition:** In one sentence, what is the unique value this site provides that alternatives do not?
  * **Success Definition:** What does success look like in 6 months? In 1 year? (e.g., number of users, revenue, leads generated).
  * **Mission Alignment:** How does this project support broader business objectives?

#### 👥 **Target Audience & User Research**

  * **Primary Audience:** Describe the ideal primary user. (Consider demographics, technical skills, motivations, and goals).
  * **Secondary Audiences:** Are there other important user groups we should consider?
  * **User Pain Points:** What specific frustrations or challenges do these users currently face that this website will address?
  * **Current Solutions:** How do users currently solve this problem or get this information? What are they using now?
  * **Usage Context:** Where and how will users interact with this site? (e.g., on a mobile device during a commute, on a desktop at work).

#### 🏢 **Market & Initial Competitive Landscape**

  * **Direct Competitors:** Who are the top 2-3 direct competitors? What do they do well and where do they fall short?
  * **Indirect Competitors:** Are there alternative solutions that aren't direct competitors? (e.g., using a spreadsheet, a physical store).
  * **Differentiation:** What will make this website a better choice than the competition?

#### 🛠️ **Scope & Core Requirements**

  * **Essential Features (MVP):** What are the absolute must-have features or content sections for the first launch?
  * **Key User Actions:** What is the single most important action you want a user to take on the website?
  * **"Out of Scope":** What specific features or functionality should be explicitly excluded from the initial launch?

#### 💰 **Business Goals & Monetization**

  * **Primary Business Goal:** Is the site meant to generate leads, sell products, build a community, provide information, or something else?
  * **Revenue Model:** If applicable, how will the website generate revenue? (e.g., e-commerce, subscriptions, ads).

#### 🛡️ **Constraints & Risks**

  * **Timeline:** Are there any critical deadlines or a desired launch window?
  * **Budget:** Are there known budgetary constraints that will influence the scope?
  * **Risks:** What are the biggest potential risks to the success of this project? (e.g., market adoption, technical challenges).

### **7. Integration with Future Documentation**

This document is the foundational input for all subsequent steps. It must be referenced by the AI agent when generating:

  - `competitor_research.md`
  - `architecture_content.md`
  - `design.md`
  - `technical_plan.md`
  - `mvp_tasks.md`

### **8. Best Practices**

1.  **Keep Users Central:** Every decision documented should be justifiable in terms of user value.
2.  **Validate Assumptions:** Clearly state all assumptions (e.g., "We assume our target audience prefers mobile Browse") and plans for validation.
3.  **Be Specific:** Use concrete examples and measurable criteria, especially for goals and success metrics. Avoid vague language.
4.  **Document Trade-offs:** If decisions were made to exclude certain features, briefly state the reasoning.

### **9. Output Requirements**

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
  - **Location:** `/docs/`
  - **Filename:** `website_brief.md`
  - **Audience:** Accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### **10. Final Instructions**

  - **DO NOT** generate the final document until all critical discovery questions have been answered by the user.
  - **DO** ask follow-up questions to clarify any ambiguous or incomplete responses.
  - **DO** validate your understanding by summarizing key findings back to the user before writing the full brief.
  - **DO** ensure the "Next Steps" section is clear and actionable.

### **11. Key Success Factors**

  - **Clarity and Alignment:** The document successfully creates a single, shared understanding of the project's foundation.
  - **Evidence-Based:** Key decisions (especially around audience and problem statements) are clearly justified.
  - **Actionable:** The brief is robust enough to directly inform the next stage of research and planning without requiring major revisions.
  - **Focused Scope:** Provides a clear definition of the MVP to prevent scope creep.
