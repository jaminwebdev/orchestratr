# **Rule: Site Architecture & Content Planning Generation**

### **1. Goal**

To guide an AI assistant in creating the `03_create_architecture_content.md` document. This document acts as the official blueprint for the website, translating the strategic goals and keyword research into a logical sitemap and an actionable content plan.

It is created for UX/UI designers, content writers, and developers. It will directly inform the wireframing process, all copywriting tasks, and the setup of the website's structure in the Content Management System (CMS).

### **2. Process**

1.  **Review Dependencies:** The agent **MUST** first ingest and analyze both `/docs/01_create_brief_audience.md` and `/docs/02_create_competitor_keyword_research.md`. The goals, user personas, keyword clusters, and audience questions are the raw materials for this step.
2.  **Consult Library Docs:** Review `design_ux/sitemaps_best_practices.md` and the documents in the `copywriting/` directory to ground the process in established best practices.
3.  **Conduct Structured Discovery:** Use the question framework below to work with the user to structure the information, define the content strategy, and outline page-level requirements.
4.  **Generate Document:** Create the `Site Architecture & Content Planning` document using the specified structure.
5.  **Quality Assurance:** Perform a validation check using the QA framework to ensure the blueprint is logical, complete, and strategically sound.
6.  **Save and Version:** Save the final document as `03_create_architecture_content.md` in the `/docs` directory.

### **3. Discovery Framework**

#### 🗺️ **Site Structure & Sitemap**

  * "Looking at the keyword clusters in `02_research`, let's group them into the main pages for our top-level navigation. What should the main items be? (e.g., Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact)."
  * "Which keyword clusters should be nested as sub-pages? For example, should 'Service A' and 'Service B' live under 'Services'?"
  * "What is the single most important path you want a user to take? (e.g., from the Homepage, through a Service page, to the Contact form)."
  * "What utility links should be included in the footer? (e.g., Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Careers)."

#### ✍️ **Content Strategy & Voice**

  * "If your brand were a person, what three words would describe its personality? (e.g., 'Expert,' 'Friendly,' 'Innovative')."
  * "Based on that personality, what should the overall tone of voice be? (e.g., Formal and professional, casual and witty, inspirational and supportive)."
  * "Are there specific taglines or key messages from the Product Brief we need to weave into the content?"
  * "Beyond text, what other types of content will we need? (e.g., video, case studies, infographics, photo galleries)."

#### 🧩 **Page-Level Content Requirements**

  * "Let's outline the Homepage. What are the essential sections or 'blocks' of content it needs to have to guide the user?"
  * "For a primary Service or Product page, what information is critical to include to persuade a user?"
  * "What is the primary Call-to-Action (CTA) for the Homepage? What about for a blog post or a service page?"

```

### **5. Quality Assurance Framework**

  - [ ] **Strategic Alignment:** Does the sitemap directly reflect the goals from `01_brief` and the keyword themes from `02_research`?
  - [ ] **Logical Flow:** Is the sitemap hierarchy logical and easy for a user to understand?
  - [ ] **Keyword Mapping:** Is a primary target keyword assigned to every significant page in the sitemap?
  - [ ] **Actionable Blueprints:** Are the page blueprints detailed enough for a designer and writer to begin their work?
  - [ ] **Consistent Voice:** Is the defined tone and voice consistent with the brand identity in the Product Brief?

### **6. Supporting Library Documents**

  - `design_ux/sitemaps_best_practices.md`: **(Primary)** Must be used to guide the creation of a logical and SEO-friendly sitemap.
  - `copywriting/copy_101.md`: To inform the core messaging hierarchy.
  - `copywriting/copy_best_practices.md`: To guide the Tone & Voice section.
  - `copywriting/copy_ctas.md`: To help define the primary and secondary Calls-to-Action for page blueprints.
  - `copywriting/copy_headline_formulas.md`: To assist in defining the purpose of hero sections and headlines.

### **7. Integration with Other Documentation**

  - **Input:** Heavily dependent on `/docs/01_create_brief_audience.md` and `/docs/02_create_competitor_keyword_research.md`.
  - **Output:** This document is the primary blueprint for `04_create_design_content.md`.

### **8. Best Practices**

1.  **User-First Architecture:** Design the sitemap around user tasks and journeys, not just the company structure.
2.  **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Navigation and page titles should be clear and descriptive.
3.  **Content Before Design:** The page blueprints ensure that the design will serve the content, not the other way around.
4.  **Scalability:** The architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate future growth and new content sections.

### **9. Output Requirements**

  - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
  - **Location:** `/docs/`
  - **Filename:** `03_create_architecture_content.md`

### **10. Final Instructions**

  - **DO NOT** create the sitemap without first analyzing the keyword clusters from `02_research`.
  - **DO** ensure that every page in the main navigation has a clear purpose and maps to a user or business goal.
  - **DO** use the page blueprints as the single source of truth for what content needs to be on a given page.
  - **DO** confirm the primary user journey with the user to ensure it aligns with their business objectives.

### **11. Key Success Factors**

  - **The Bridge:** The document successfully bridges the gap between abstract strategy and concrete design/content tasks.
  - **Clarity of Purpose:** Every page in the sitemap has a clear reason to exist.
  - **Efficiency:** Provides a clear plan that prevents rework during the design and copywriting phases.
  - **SEO Foundation:** The architecture is inherently optimized by being built upon the keyword strategy.
